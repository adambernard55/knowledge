**Expert Notes & Tips:** Descript revolutionizes audio/video editing workflow, especially for dialogue-heavy content. The text-based editing is incredibly intuitive. Studio Sound works remarkably well for cleaning up noisy audio. Overdub requires initial voice training and consent; it's great for minor corrections. Transcription accuracy is high but always worth a quick review. Excellent tool for podcasters, video marketers, and course creators.
