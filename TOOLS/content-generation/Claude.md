* Experiment with different models in the Claude family (Haiku for speed/cost, Sonnet for balance, Opus for maximum intelligence) depending on your task and budget.  
* "Prompt engineering" is key: provide clear, detailed, and well-structured prompts to get the best results. Utilize techniques like providing examples or asking Claude to adopt a specific persona.  
* While powerful for drafting, always review and edit AI-generated content to ensure accuracy, brand voice alignment, and originality.  
* For sensitive tasks or critical information, cross-verify any factual claims made by the AI.
