# **Lately**

Lately uses AI to automatically repurpose long-form content (like blog posts, webinars, podcasts) into dozens of short-form social media posts tailored for different platforms. It aims to dramatically increase content output and efficiency for social media marketing.

**Key Features:**

* AI Content Repurposing Engine: Analyzes long-form text, audio, or video to identify key quotes/ideas and generate social posts.  
* Generates posts with suggested text, relevant hashtags, and links.  
* Ability to connect multiple social media accounts for scheduling.  
* Content scheduling and calendar features.  
* Analytics to track performance of generated posts.  
* Allows for human review and editing before publishing.

**Marketing Use Cases:**

* Massively scaling social media content creation by repurposing existing assets.  
* Ensuring consistent messaging across platforms derived from core content pieces.  
* Saving significant time compared to manually creating dozens of social posts.  
* Getting more mileage out of webinars, podcasts, and blog articles.  
* Generating social media copy for team members or clients based on approved long-form content.

**Pricing Overview:** Subscription-based SaaS model. Pricing is typically tiered based on the number of users, connected accounts, volume of content generated, and feature access. Often targets businesses and agencies needing high-volume output. Pricing information may require contacting sales or viewing specific plan pages, potentially starting in the mid-range (e.g., $100+/month). *Subject to change; check website for current pricing.*

**Expert Notes & Tips:** Lately's core strength is its AI-driven repurposing engine, designed to understand context and generate genuinely relevant short posts from long content. It's different from basic schedulers; the value lies in the automated *creation* of many posts from one source. Reviewing and potentially tweaking the AI-generated posts is still recommended. Excellent for teams with a strong foundation of long-form content they want to amplify efficiently on social media.
