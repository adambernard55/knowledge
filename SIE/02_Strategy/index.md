# 🧠 Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE): Master Context

Welcome to the central repository for the Strategic Intelligence Engine framework. This document provides a condensed, high-level summary of the core system, its operational rules, and the business strategy, drawing key principles from each foundational document.

---

## [01 The Engine](./01%20Engine/)

Defines the purpose, rules, and operational schema of the SIE. These documents govern its behavior and structure.

-   #### [`00_engine-overview.md`](./01%20Engine/00_engine-overview.md): Engine Purpose & Functions
    -   **Core Purpose:** To build, govern, and activate a client's **Master Hub**, transforming scattered knowledge into a single, living, and intelligent asset.
    -   **Primary Functions:** 1) Ingest & Structure data, 2) Govern & Maintain consistency, 3) Automate & Execute tasks (like SEO), and 4) Analyze & Synthesize new insights over time.

-   #### [`01_governance-rules.md`](./01%20Engine/01_governance-rules.md): Core Operational Rules
    -   **Key Principles:** The engine must always adhere to `Master Hub Precedence` (Rule G-01), operate under a `Mandatory Human Approval` protocol for key actions (Rule G-04), enforce `Schema Adherence` for all data (Rule I-02), and `Log all Significant Actions` (Rule G-03).

-   #### [`02_interaction-logs.md`](./01%20Engine/02_interaction-logs.md): System Activity Record
    -   **Core Concept:** A chronological, immutable record of all significant actions, flags, and events generated by the engine. It is the system's "black box recorder" for audit and traceability.

-   #### [`04_schema.md`](./01%20Engine/04_schema.md): Data Structure Definition
    -   **Core Concept:** Defines the required metadata (YAML frontmatter) and content structure for all documents within the Master Hub. This is the master specification for data validation.

---

## [02 The Strategy](./02%20Strategy/)

Outlines the business model, target audience, and go-to-market plan for the SIE as a commercial product and service.

-   #### [`00_core-vision-and-mission.md`](./02%20Strategy/00_core-vision-and-mission.md): The Business Strategy
    -   **Vision:** A world where every business operates from a central intelligence that learns, adapts, and grows with them.
    -   **Mission:** To build and activate a Master Hub for every client, transforming their scattered knowledge into a strategic asset.
    -   **Unfair Advantage:** A proprietary methodology (the `Ignition Sequence`) for structuring a business's core knowledge, built on a 25-year framework.

-   #### [`01_icp-and-personas.md`](./02%20Strategy/01_icp-and-personas.md): Target Audience
    -   **Primary ICP (End-User):** "Knowledge-Aware" Mid-Market Companies ($10M-$100M revenue) who recognize their institutional knowledge is a key asset.
    -   **Secondary ICP (Channel Partner):** Strategic Digital Marketing & Consulting Agencies who want to productize their expertise and create recurring revenue.

-   #### [`02_go-to-market-plan.md`](./02%20Strategy/02_go-to-market-plan.md): The Commercialization Plan
    -   **Phase 1 (R&D Lab):** Perfect the engine as a proprietary "consultant's secret weapon" under the `AdamBernard.com` brand, working with 4-6 paid pilots.
    -   **Phase 2 (Productization):** Launch the battle-tested system as a scalable, partner-focused offering under the credible `LynxDigital.com` brand.
