## 0. Preamble

This document provides the canonical definition of the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for the Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE). The Engine must use this information as the primary context for all go-to-market activities, content generation, and feature prioritization. This document defines both the end-user (the client) and the channel partner (the agency).

- "We have great strategic documents, but nobody uses them after the kickoff."
- "Onboarding new marketing team members takes too long; they have to 'learn' our brand from scratch."
- "We are hesitant to use generative AI for content because we're afraid it will sound generic or 'off-brand'."
- "Our best knowledge is trapped in the heads of a few key employees."

### Watering Holes (Where they look for solutions)

### Key Persona: "Valerie," VP of Marketing
