# Organic Visibility

## Strategic Intent
This pillar defines our approach to digital presence. We move beyond traditional keyword stuffing toward **Semantic Authority** and **Agentic Readiness**. Our goal is to be the primary citation source for both human users and AI agents.

## Core Frameworks
*These documents define the 'Rules of Engagement' for this domain.*

- **[[01_seo-fundamentals]]**: The baseline mechanics of search (Crawl, Index, Rank).
- **[[06_semantic-seo]]**: Establishing topical authority through entity mapping.
- **[[geo-playbook]]**: Optimizing for AI Overviews and Generative Engines.

## Operational Playbooks
*Actionable guides for daily implementation.*

- [[seo-ethics-and-safety]]: Guidelines for white-hat practices and risk mitigation.
- [[keyword-research-workflow]]: (Placeholder for your specific workflow).

## The Knowledge Cluster
*Complete index of research and reference materials.*

```markdown
`$= dv.list(dv.pages('"kb/SEO"').where(p => p.type != "pillar").sort(p => p.file.name).file.link)`
