## 0. Preamble

This document serves as the official, immutable log of all significant interactions performed by the Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE). Each entry is a record of an automated or human-approved action, designed for audit, review, and traceability.

**NOTE:** New log entries are always added to the top of the "Log Entries" section (reverse chronological order).
