# ⚙️ The Core System & Context

This section contains the foundational documents that define the internal architecture and operating principles of the **Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE)**. This index file provides a condensed summary of each document's core principles.

## System Documents

-   [`00_engine-overview.md`](SIE/01_Core/00_core-purpose.md): Engine Purpose & Functions
    -   **Core Purpose:** To build, govern, and activate a client's **Master Hub**, transforming scattered knowledge into a single, living, and intelligent asset.
    -   **Primary Functions:** 1) Ingest & Structure data, 2) Govern & Maintain consistency, 3) Automate & Execute tasks (like SEO), and 4) Analyze & Synthesize new insights over time.

-   [`01_governance-rules.md`](SIE/01_Core/01_governance-rules.md): Core Operational Rules
    -   **Key Principles:** The engine must always adhere to `Master Hub Precedence` (Rule G-01), operate under a `Mandatory Human Approval` protocol for key actions (Rule G-04), enforce `Schema Adherence` for all data (Rule I-02), and `Log all Significant Actions` (Rule G-03).

-   [`02_interaction-logs.md`](SIE/98_Logs/00_interaction-logs.md): System Activity Record
    -   **Core Concept:** A chronological, immutable record of all significant actions, flags, and events generated by the engine. It is the system's "black box recorder" for audit and traceability.

-   [`04_schema.md`](SIE/01_Core/03_schema.md): Data Structure Definition
    -   **Core Concept:** Defines the required metadata (YAML frontmatter) and content structure for all documents within the Master Hub. This is the master specification for data validation.

-  [[SIE/01_Core/02_glossary|Glossary]]: System Terminology
	- **Core Concept:** Canonical definitions of all key terms, concepts, and system components. Reference this document for consistent terminology usage across all documentation.
