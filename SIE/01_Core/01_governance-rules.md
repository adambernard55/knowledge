## 0. Preamble

This document contains the operational rules the **Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE)** must adhere to in all functions. These rules are derived from the core purpose and principles outlined in `00_engine-overview.md` and are designed to ensure consistency, reliability, and safety.

## 1. General Governance Principles

These principles apply to all engine functions and supersede any specific rules in case of conflict.

-   **Rule G-01 (Master Hub Precedence):** The Master Hub is the single, immutable source of truth. All Engine analysis, generation, and actions must be grounded in the data contained within the Hub. The Engine must not utilize external, generalized knowledge that contradicts the Hub's canonical information.

-   **Rule G-02 (Strict Contextualization):** Every query or task must be framed with the maximum relevant context from the Master Hub. The Engine must prioritize documents from relevant folders (e.g., `/products/` for a product question) to ensure hyper-relevant outputs.

-   **Rule G-03 (Action Logging):** All significant write-actions performed by the Engine must be logged in `02_interaction-logs.md`. This includes, but is not limited to:
    -   Creation or modification of files.
    -   Generation of content drafts.
    -   Identification of significant data conflicts or stale content.
    -   Execution of automated tasks (e.g., internal link insertion).

-   **Rule G-04 (Mandatory Human Approval):** The Engine operates under a "human-in-the-loop" protocol. The following actions require explicit human approval before execution:
    -   Any destructive action (e.g., deleting or overwriting a file).
    -   Publishing content to an external system (e.g., WordPress).
    -   Modifying a core strategic document within the `/strategy/` folder.

## 2. Ingestion & Structuring Rules

These rules govern how new information is added to the Master Hub.

-   **Rule I-01 (Ignition Sequence Processing):** All initial data from the `2.1 SIE Ignition Sequence.md` must be processed and structured into the corresponding files and folders as defined by the `Project Structure Guide.md`.

-   **Rule I-02 (Schema Adherence):** All new or modified documents must be validated against the `1.2 SIE Schema.md`. Files that do not conform to the schema must be flagged for manual review and correction.

-   **Rule I-03 (Unstructured Data Protocol):** Raw, unstructured data (e.g., meeting transcripts, raw customer feedback) must not be directly placed into the core Hub folders. It must be placed in a designated `/intake/` directory and flagged for a human-led synthesis and structuring process.

## 3. Maintenance & Governance Rules

These rules define the Engine's proactive duties in maintaining the health of the Master Hub.

-   **Rule M-01 (Periodic Audits):** The Engine must perform regular, automated audits of the Master Hub to check for:
    -   **Link Integrity:** Identify and flag any broken internal links between documents.
    -   **Metadata Consistency:** Ensure all files have the required frontmatter properties (`title`, `id`, `status`).
    -   **Stale Content:** Flag any document whose `updated` date is older than a predefined threshold (default: 180 days) for a "freshness review."

-   **Rule M-02 (Conflict Resolution):** If the Engine detects directly conflicting statements between two canonical documents within the Hub (e.g., two different prices for the same product), it must not act on either piece of information. It must flag the conflict, citing both source documents, for human resolution in the `02_interaction-logs.md`.

## 4. Automation & Execution Rules

These rules govern the Engine's generative and automated tasks.

-   **Rule A-01 (Generation Mandate):** All generated content (drafts, summaries, briefs) must be derived exclusively from the Master Hub's data set. The prompt sent to the LLM must explicitly forbid the use of general knowledge for factual claims about the business.

-   **Rule A-02 (Semantic Linking Logic):** When suggesting internal links, the primary basis for connection must be semantic relevance and topical authority, not simple keyword matching. The Engine should prioritize linking to foundational documents in `/products/`, `/strategy/`, or `/intelligence/`.

-   **Rule A-03 (Attribution):** Any file or significant portion of a file generated by the Engine must be clearly marked as such, either via a `generated_by: SIE` frontmatter property or an inline comment, to ensure clear traceability.

- **Rule D-04:** (Glossary Maintenance): New system terms MUST be added to the glossary within 24 hours - Definitions must be reviewed by steward before publication - All core documents must link to glossary terms on first use
