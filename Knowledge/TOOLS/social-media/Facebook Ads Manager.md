**Expert Notes & Tips:** Meta's AI plays a huge role in modern campaign performance. Understanding targeting options is crucial, but increasingly, broader targeting combined with Advantage+ features allows the AI more room to optimize. Focus on high-quality creative and clear conversion tracking (Meta Pixel, Conversions API). Test Advantage+ campaigns, but retain manual control for specific strategic needs. Continuously monitor performance and iterate based on data. Effective use requires understanding both the manual controls and how to best leverage the platform's automation.
