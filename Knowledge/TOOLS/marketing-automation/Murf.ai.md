**Expert Notes & Tips:** Murf offers a wide selection of high-quality, natural-sounding voices compared to basic TTS. Experiment with different voices and settings (pitch, speed, emphasis) to get the desired result. Use punctuation effectively in your script to guide pauses. Proofread scripts carefully before generating. Pro plans are usually needed for commercial usage rights. Good alternative or supplement to Synthesia if only audio voiceover is needed.
