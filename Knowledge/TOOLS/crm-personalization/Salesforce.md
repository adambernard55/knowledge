**AI Focus:** The core AI focus is on leveraging a company's own customer data to provide predictive analytics, natural language understanding, and generative AI. This includes predictive lead scoring, sales forecasting, personalized recommendations, automated email/content generation, and conversational AI for chatbots and agent assistance.

**Pricing Overview:** Enterprise-focused SaaS platform with custom pricing. Plans are complex, tiered by "Cloud" (Sales, Service, Marketing, etc.) and feature level (e.g., Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited). AI features are typically included in higher-tier plans. It represents a significant investment and requires consultation with their sales team for a quote.

**Expert Notes & Tips:** Salesforce's greatest strength is its integrated ecosystem, providing a single source of truth for customer data that powers its AI. It is incredibly powerful but requires significant investment in implementation, customization, and administration to realize its full potential. Clean, well-structured data is essential for the AI to perform effectively. Best suited for mid-market to large enterprises committed to a data-driven sales and marketing strategy.
