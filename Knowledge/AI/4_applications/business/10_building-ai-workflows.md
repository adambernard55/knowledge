# Building Reliable AI Workflows

This guide outlines a three-part framework for transforming ad-hoc AI experimentation into a repeatable and reliable engineering practice. The core components are **agentic primitives** (reusable AI building blocks) and **context engineering** (strategic information management).

## The AI-Native Development Framework

Reliable AI workflows are built on three interconnected layers:

1.  **Markdown Prompt Engineering:** Using Markdown's structure to create clear, precise, and context-rich prompts for predictable AI interactions.
2.  **Agentic Primitives:** Systematizing prompt engineering techniques into reusable, configurable files that act as building blocks for AI agents.
3.  **Context Engineering:** Strategically managing the information (context) provided to an AI to optimize its focus, performance, and use of its limited memory (context window).

These layers combine to create **Agentic Workflows**: complete, systematic processes that are reliable and predictable.

### Layer 1: Strategic Prompt Engineering with Markdown

Using Markdown's structure (headers, lists, links) helps guide an AI's reasoning process, leading to more consistent outputs.

**Key Techniques:**

*   **Role Activation:** Define the AI's expertise.
    *   *Example:* `You are an expert debugger, specialized in debugging complex programming issues.`
*   **Context Loading:** Inject relevant information using links to files or websites.
    *   *Example:* `Review the [error logs](./logs/error.log) and the [architecture document](./docs/architecture.md).`
*   **Structured Thinking:** Use headers and lists to create a clear, step-by-step reasoning path.
*   **Tool Integration:** Instruct the AI to use specific tools in a controlled way.
    *   *Example:* `Use the \`azmcp-monitor-log-query\` MCP tool to retrieve infrastructure logs.`
*   **Validation Gates:** Implement human oversight at critical decision points.
    *   *Example:* `Present your analysis and suggested solutions to the user and seek validation before proceeding.`

### Layer 2: Agentic Primitives

Agentic primitives are modular, reusable files that provide specific capabilities, rules, or instructions to an AI agent. They turn manual prompting techniques into a scalable system.

| Primitive File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`.instructions.md`** | Provides structured, repository-specific guidance and preferences. |
| **`.chatmode.md`** | Deploys role-based expertise and sets tool boundaries to prevent cross-domain interference. |
| **`.prompt.md`** | Defines reusable, multi-step workflows with built-in validation gates. |
| **`.spec.md`** | Creates implementation-ready blueprints to ensure repeatable results. |
| **`.memory.md`** | Preserves knowledge, decisions, and patterns across sessions. |
| **`.context.md`** | Acts as a helper file to optimize and accelerate information retrieval. |

### Layer 3: Context Engineering

Context engineering ensures the AI focuses on relevant information, preserving its limited context window and improving reliability.

**Key Techniques:**

*   **Session Splitting:** Use distinct agent sessions for different tasks (e.g., planning, implementation, testing) to provide fresh, focused context.
*   **Modular Instructions:** Apply targeted `.instructions.md` files only where relevant using YAML frontmatter (`applyTo:`), reducing irrelevant suggestions.
*   **Memory-Driven Development:** Use `.memory.md` files to maintain project knowledge across sessions without re-explaining context.
*   **Context Optimization:** Use `.context.md` helper files to strategically load only the most critical information.
*   **Cognitive Focus Optimization:** Use `.chatmode.md` files to keep the AI's attention on a specific domain and prevent context pollution.

## Scaling Workflows with Tooling

To scale agentic primitives beyond individual use, treat them as "natural language as code" and support them with proper infrastructure.

### Agent CLI Runtimes

Command-line interface (CLI) runtimes like **GitHub Copilot CLI** allow agentic workflows to be executed, automated, and integrated into larger systems outside of the IDE.

*   **Inner Loop (IDE):** Interactive development, debugging, and refinement of workflows (e.g., using GitHub Copilot in VS Code).
*   **Outer Loop (CLI):** Reproducible execution, automation, and CI/CD integration for production environments.

### Agent Package Manager (APM)

APM is a tool for managing and distributing agent primitives, similar to `npm` for JavaScript. It handles the complexity of sharing workflows across teams.

**Core Functions:**

*   **Runtime Management:** Installs and configures different Agent CLI runtimes (`apm runtime setup copilot`).
*   **Dependency Management:** Manages dependencies on tools and other primitives (`apm install`).
*   **Project Configuration:** Uses an `apm.yml` file (like `package.json`) to define scripts, dependencies, and parameters.
*   **Distribution:** Packages agent primitives and their configurations for easy sharing and reuse.

### Production Deployment

With tooling like APM, agentic workflows can be integrated directly into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using a GitHub Action). This allows for the automation of tasks like code reviews, security analysis, and testing, bringing AI-driven processes into production environments with the same reliability as traditional code.
