# Understanding Search Intent: The Foundation of Effective SEO

## Introduction

Search intent, also known as user intent or query intent, is the primary goal a user has when typing a query into a search engine. It's the "why" behind the search—what the user hopes to accomplish, find, or learn. Understanding and aligning your content with search intent is arguably the most critical factor in modern SEO success.

In today's search landscape, it's no longer enough to simply match keywords. Search engines have evolved to understand the context and purpose behind searches, rewarding content that best satisfies the user's actual needs. This shift from keyword-matching to intent-matching represents a fundamental evolution in how search engines work and how we must approach SEO.
