# How to Write an SEO Blog Post: 13 Key Tips

Writing an SEO blog post used to mean one thing: optimizing for Google. But the search landscape has changed dramatically because of AI.

Today, people also search for information using AI assistants like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude. Even Google’s AI Overviews and AI Mode use AI to generate direct answers to user queries. That means your blog post needs to rank in traditional search results **and** appear in AI answers.

The tips below will show you exactly how to write SEO-friendly blog posts that reach users across the full spectrum of modern search experiences.

## 1. Choose a Target Keyword or Prompt

Select a target keyword or prompt for your blog post to help both search engines and AI systems understand what your content is about.

A target keyword ([primary keyword](https://www.semrush.com/blog/primary-keywords/)) is the main term you want the page to rank for. However, you must also consider **prompts**—the natural language questions people ask AI.

**Key Metrics to Analyze:**
- **Intent:** The main goal behind the user’s search.
- **Volume:** Estimated monthly searches.
- **Keyword Difficulty (KD%):** How hard it is to rank based on authority.
- **SERP Features:** Look for "AI Overviews" or "People Also Ask" boxes to understand how Google answers the query.

## 2. Meet Search Intent

Search intent is the purpose behind the user’s query. Google ranks webpages that match intent; AI systems cite sources that directly satisfy the underlying need.

**How to determine intent:**
1.  **Analyze Top Results:** If Google shows how-to guides, write a guide. If it shows lists, write a listicle.
2.  **Check AI Responses:** Enter the keyword into ChatGPT. Does it provide a step-by-step answer or a comparison?

## 3. Start Writing a High-Quality, Well-Structured Blog Post

Structure influences how well AI can extract answers from your content.

**Best Practices:**
- **Strong Hook:** Address the problem immediately in the intro.
- **Clear Subheadings:** Use H2s and H3s to organize content.
- **Direct Answers:** Start each section with the key takeaway (the "BLUF" method - Bottom Line Up Front). This makes your content easily citable by AI.
- **Short Paragraphs:** Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences.

## 4. Include Fresh Information On Your Topic

Fresh content is a strong predictor of AI visibility. Brands that update pages with new data earn significantly more citations from ChatGPT and Perplexity.

**Action:** Display your "Last Updated" date prominently. Ensure statistics and examples are from the current year.

## 5. Use Keywords or Prompts Throughout Your Blog Post

Include terms naturally without keyword stuffing.

- **Primary Keyword:** In Title, Intro, and Conclusion.
- **Variations:** Use synonyms (e.g., "content marketing tactics" vs. "marketing content tips").
- **Question Keywords:** Use natural language questions in H2s/H3s to capture voice search and AI prompts.

## 6. Add Visuals and Multimedia

Images and videos increase engagement and dwell time.
- **Video:** If the intent is "how-to," embed a video tutorial.
- **Optimization:** Compress images and use descriptive Alt Text containing keywords.

## 7. Create an Optimized Title Tag

The title tag is the clickable link in search results.
- **Length:** Keep under 55 characters.
- **Placement:** Put the primary keyword near the beginning.
- **Click-worthiness:** Make it compelling.

## 8. Write an Engaging Meta Description

While not a direct ranking factor, the meta description drives Click-Through Rate (CTR).
- **Length:** ~105-120 characters.
- **Content:** Include the keyword and a Call to Action (CTA).

## 9. Include a Detailed Author Bio

Author bios establish **E-E-A-T** (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust).
- **Credentials:** List degrees, certifications, and experience.
- **Link:** Link to the author's full bio page or LinkedIn.
- **Why it matters:** AI systems prioritize content from credible, knowledgeable sources.

## 10. Add Expert Insights

Content enhanced with unique insights ranks higher than generic summaries.
- **Interviews:** Quote internal SMEs (Subject Matter Experts).
- **Original Data:** Use proprietary data if available.

## 11. Include Stats In Your Content

Adding statistics can lead to ~33% higher visibility in AI-powered search platforms.
- **Specificity:** Use "67% of businesses" instead of "many businesses."
- **Citations:** Link to the original study.
- **Brevity:** Present stats clearly so AI can extract them.

## 12. Add Links to Other Relevant Content

Internal links help search engines crawl your site and establish **Topical Authority**.
- **Anchor Text:** Use descriptive text (e.g., "read our guide on technical SEO" rather than "click here").
- **Relevance:** Only link to helpful, related resources.

## 13. Use a Short, SEO-Friendly URL

- **Structure:** `domain.com/blog/keyword-slug`
- **Best Practice:** Keep it short, lowercase, and use hyphens to separate words. Avoid dates in URLs if possible to keep content "evergreen."
