## The Three Pillars of SEO

Modern SEO is generally categorized into three main areas:

### 1. On-Page SEO (The Content)

This is everything you do _on_ your actual pages to help search engines understand your content.

> **Deep Dive:** See [[kb/SEO/How to Write an SEO Blog Post|How to Write an SEO Blog Post]] for a 13-step execution guide.

- **Keyword Research:** Identifying the specific terms your customers use...
    

### 2. Technical SEO (The Engine)

This refers to backend optimizations that help search engines crawl and index your site effectively.

- **Site Speed:** Google prioritizes fast-loading sites.
    
- **Mobile-Friendliness:** With mobile-first indexing, your site must look and perform perfectly on smartphones.
    
- **Crawlability:** Ensuring your `robots.txt` and XML sitemaps are correctly configured so bots don't get lost.
    

### 3. Off-Page SEO (The Reputation)

This involves actions taken outside of your own website to impact your rankings.

- **Backlinks:** When other reputable sites link to yours, it acts as a "vote of confidence."
    
- **Social Signals:** While not a direct ranking factor, brand mentions on social media increase visibility.
    
- **E-E-A-T:** A critical Google guideline standing for **Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness**.

## Why SEO Matters in 2025

| **Benefit**                | **Description**                                                                                                                    |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Compounding Traffic**    | Unlike paid ads (PPC), which stop the moment you stop paying, SEO traffic is "organic" and builds over time.                       |
| **Trust & Credibility**    | Users generally trust organic results more than "Sponsored" ads.                                                                   |
| **Lower Acquisition Cost** | Over the long term, organic search is often the most cost-effective way to acquire new customers.                                  |
| **AI Integration**         | In 2025, SEO also means optimizing for **AI Overviews** (SGE), ensuring your content is clear enough for LLMs to cite as a source. |

## Key 2025 Trends

- **Search Intent over Keywords:** Google now focuses on _why_ someone is searching (e.g., are they looking to buy, or just looking for information?) rather than just matching a phrase.
    
- **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO):** Adapting content so it appears in AI-generated search summaries.
    
- **Zero-Click Searches:** Crafting content that provides value even if a user doesn't click through, often via "Featured Snippets."
