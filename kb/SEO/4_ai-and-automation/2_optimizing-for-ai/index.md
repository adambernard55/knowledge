# Optimizing for AI

This section covers the strategic shift required to succeed in a search landscape dominated by AI. The documents here focus on how to optimize your content not just for traditional crawlers and human readers, but for the new audience of autonomous AI agents and generative answer engines.

**A Note on Terminology:** The industry is currently in a dynamic phase of naming this new discipline, with terms like **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**, **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)**, and **AI SEO** all being used. While the final term may evolve, the core principle remains the same: optimizing for a world where AI-driven "information engines" are a primary channel for discovery.

## Contents

- **[[01_geo-optimization|Generative Engine Optimization (GEO): Optimizing for AI Overviews]]** — This document defines Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the practice of structuring content to be cited in AI-generated search results like Google's AI Overviews. It outlines four core strategies: increasing fact density with original data and citations to boost E-E-A-T; optimizing for machine-readability with granular, atomic content structures; expanding the semantic footprint with comprehensive schema; and building entity authority through consistent information across trusted sources. GEO is presented as the evolution of SEO for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based search paradigm.
- **[[02_agentic-seo|Agentic SEO: Achieving Agentic Readiness for AI Systems]]** — This document defines Agentic SEO as the practice of optimizing digital assets to be understood, trusted, and used by autonomous AI agents. It outlines four pillars of 'Agentic Readiness': Data Enrichment, Content Modularity, Polymorphism, and Technical Accessibility, with the goal of creating machine-operable assets like APIs and feeds for the new agentic engine of online visibility.
- **[[03_ai-search-optimization-roadmap.md|AI Search Optimization Roadmap: A Strategic Framework]]** — This document provides a strategic 10-step roadmap for adapting SEO to AI-driven search.

The guide positions these workflows as essential for scaling optimization efforts and building the foundation for machine-operable content required by Agentic SEO.
- **[[06_preparing-for-generative-engine-optimization-geo|Content Clustering for Semantic Depth]]** — This guide details an advanced content clustering strategy for building topical authority and semantic depth. It defines the "Deep Cluster Model," a hierarchical structure consisting of a main pillar page, comprehensive sub-pillar pages, and specific spoke pages. The framework emphasizes covering multiple levels of user intent (informational, commercial, transactional) and implementing a strategic internal linking plan to signal expertise to search engines.
- **[[07_generative-engine-optimization-playbook|The GEO Playbook: How to Get Cited and Recommended by AI]]** — This playbook provides a framework for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), detailing how to get content cited by AI models.
