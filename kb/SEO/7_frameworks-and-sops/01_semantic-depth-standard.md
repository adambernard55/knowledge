# SOP: The Semantic Depth Standard

## 1. Preamble

This document establishes the official standard for content quality, known as **Semantic Depth**. Adherence to this standard is mandatory for all new content creation and existing content audits. The goal is to create content that aligns with Google's core ranking systems, provides maximum value to the user, and builds long-term resilience against algorithmic updates.

This standard is derived from the findings in the [[kb/SEO/1_research-and-strategy/14_semantic-depth|Semantic Depth Guide]].

## 2. The Three Pillars of Semantic Depth

All content must be created and evaluated against the following three pillars:

1.  **People-First Completeness:** The content must provide a **substantial, complete, or comprehensive** description of the topic that fully satisfies a user’s primary goal. Depth is measured by goal completion, not word count.
2.  **System-Aligned Meaning:** The content must be structured so that Google’s ranking systems (like **BERT** and **RankBrain**) can correctly map it to **concepts, meanings, and intent**. It must be optimized for meaning, not just keywords.
3.  **Core Update Resilience:** The content must contribute to a durable, site-wide quality posture. This is achieved through meaningful, user-centric improvements, not temporary "quick fixes."

## 3. Core Principles for Implementation

-   **Principle 1: Satisfy the Goal.** Every piece of content must be designed to be the last click for a user on their specific search journey.
-   **Principle 2: Design for Concepts.** Content planning must begin with a map of concepts and entities, not just a list of keywords.
-   **Principle 3: Prioritize Originality.** Content must provide unique value through original information, research, analysis, or firsthand experience.
-   **Principle 4: Operate as a System.** Quality is not a one-time task. It is a continuous process of creation, auditing, and improvement.

## 4. Implementation Tools

To ensure this standard is met consistently, the following operational documents must be used:

-   **For New Content:** All content creation must begin with the [[kb/SEO/8_frameworks-and-sops/02_semantic-depth-content-brief-template|Semantic Depth Content Brief Template]].
-   **For Existing Content:** All content audits must be performed using the [[kb/SEO/8_frameworks-and-sops/03_semantic-depth-audit-checklist|Semantic Depth Audit Checklist]].
