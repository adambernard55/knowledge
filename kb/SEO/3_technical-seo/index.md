# Technical SEO

This section covers the technical foundation that enables search engines to efficiently find, understand, and rank your content. These documents dive into the infrastructure of a website, from ensuring pages are crawlable and indexable to optimizing for performance, mobile-friendliness, and semantic meaning.

A strong technical SEO implementation is the bedrock upon which all other content and authority-building efforts are built.
