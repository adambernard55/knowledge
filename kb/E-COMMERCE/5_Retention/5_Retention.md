# Retention Module — Context Index

## Overview

The post-purchase phase is where e-commerce profitability is determined. Acquiring a customer initiates the relationship; retaining that customer, deepening loyalty, and converting satisfaction into advocacy determines whether the relationship generates compounding returns or a single transaction. This module provides a strategic framework for deploying AI across every dimension of the retention lifecycle.

The Retention module spans four interconnected domains. **Post-purchase communication** covers AI-personalized follow-up sequences, proactive shipping intelligence, and strategically timed review solicitation. **Churn prediction and re-engagement** addresses the behavioral signals AI monitors to identify at-risk customers and the personalized intervention strategies that retain them. **Loyalty and CLV optimization** examines how AI transforms static loyalty programs into dynamic engagement engines and how predictive CLV modeling informs resource allocation across the entire customer lifecycle. **Brand advocacy and community engagement** covers the identification and empowerment of brand advocates and the management of online communities as organic growth and feedback infrastructure.

These domains form a reinforcing cycle: effective communication builds satisfaction, satisfied customers resist churn, retained customers deepen loyalty, loyal customers become advocates, and advocates reduce acquisition costs — increasing the CLV that justifies further retention investment. AI provides the analytical, predictive, and personalization capabilities that make this cycle operationally executable at scale.

## Module Documents

| File | ID | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [5_ai-for-strategic-post-purchase-retention.md](5_ai-for-strategic-post-purchase-retention.md) | ECOM-01 | **Strategic overview** of the entire post-purchase retention lifecycle — communication, churn prediction, loyalty design, CLV optimization, and brand advocacy. Serves as the module's conceptual foundation. |
| [5_1_AI for Personalized Post-Purchase Communication Strategy.md](5_1_AI%20for%20Personalized%20Post-Purchase%20Communication%20Strategy.md) | ECOM-18 | **Post-purchase communication framework** — AI-driven follow-up sequences, channel/tone personalization, review and UGC timing optimization, and sentiment analysis as a strategic feedback loop. |
| [5_2_AI for Customer Retention, Loyalty, and CLV Optimization.md](5_2_AI%20for%20Customer%20Retention%2C%20Loyalty%2C%20and%20CLV%20Optimization.md) | ECOM-19 | **Retention mechanics** — churn signal taxonomy and prediction, personalized re-engagement strategies, dynamic loyalty program design, gamification, and AI-based CLV modeling for lifecycle resource allocation. |
| [5_3_AI for Building Brand Advocacy & Community Engagement.md](5_3_AI%20for%20Building%20Brand%20Advocacy%20%26%20Community%20Engagement.md) | ECOM-20 | **Advocacy and community strategy** — AI-driven advocate identification, word-of-mouth amplification, UGC facilitation, tiered advocacy programs, and online community management and intelligence. |

## Reading Path

For practitioners new to this domain, the recommended sequence is: ECOM-01 (strategic overview) followed by ECOM-18, ECOM-19, and ECOM-20 in order. Each document stands alone as a reference, but the sequence builds from communication fundamentals through retention mechanics to the advocacy outcomes that close the retention loop.

## Key Frameworks Referenced

- **SMART Goals** — Applied in each document to define measurable retention, loyalty, and advocacy objectives
- **STRIVE Evaluation** — Used across all documents to assess AI tooling for post-purchase applications (Strategic Fit, Technical Efficacy, ROI, Integration, Vendor Viability, Ethical & Compliance)
- **Epistemic markers** — Axiomatic, Heuristic, Conditional, and Speculative claims are labeled throughout to distinguish established principles from emerging practices
