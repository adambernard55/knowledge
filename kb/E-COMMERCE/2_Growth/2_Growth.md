# Growth and Acquisition Module Index

The Growth/Acquisition module addresses the two fundamental levers for scaling e-commerce revenue through AI: attracting qualified traffic through content and search optimization, and targeting that traffic with precision through AI-powered audience segmentation. These disciplines operate in tandem -- content and SEO generate the discovery surface, while segmentation ensures the right prospects encounter the right message at the right moment in their buying journey.

This module sits within the broader E-commerce knowledge base and focuses specifically on the acquisition phase of the customer lifecycle. The reference documents below cover the strategic frameworks, operational models, and ethical guardrails required to deploy AI effectively across content creation, search engine optimization, and audience targeting.

## Reference Documents

| Document | ID | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [[AI for E-commerce Content & SEO that Converts]] | KB/AI/MKTG/ECOM-10 | Covers AI as a content creation accelerator and SEO optimization engine. Addresses the human-AI collaboration model for product descriptions, ad copy, blog content, and email sequences. Includes technical SEO automation, topical authority strategy, AI-generated visual assets, and ethical guardrails for visual content. |
| [[Strategic AI-Powered Audience Segmentation for E-commerce]] | KB/AI/MKTG/ECOM-11 | Covers AI-enhanced segmentation models including RFM analysis, behavioral clustering, and predictive CLV. Addresses dynamic real-time segmentation, platform integration architecture across ad platforms, personalization tools, email automation, and CRM systems. Includes privacy compliance and anti-discrimination guardrails. |

## Module Scope

**Content and SEO (ECOM-10)** establishes the principles for using AI to produce, optimize, and scale e-commerce content. The document distinguishes between AI capabilities (draft generation, keyword analysis, technical auditing) and human responsibilities (brand voice enforcement, fact-checking, strategic SEO integration). It also addresses the emerging domain of AI-generated visual assets, including commercial rights, authenticity considerations, and brand consistency requirements.

**Audience Segmentation (ECOM-11)** establishes the principles for using AI to identify, classify, and dynamically target customer segments. The document progresses from foundational models (RFM, behavioral clustering) through advanced capabilities (predictive CLV, real-time dynamic segmentation) to the integration architecture required to activate segments across advertising, personalization, email, and CRM platforms.

## Cross-Document Relationships

These two reference documents share a dependency: content and SEO strategy determines what prospects discover, while segmentation strategy determines which prospects see what content. Effective deployment requires coordination between the two domains. Content should be created with specific behavioral segments in mind, and segmentation models should incorporate content engagement signals as inputs to cluster assignment and CLV prediction.

Both documents share common ethical frameworks around transparency, data privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA), and responsible AI deployment. Teams working in either domain should be familiar with the guardrails established in both references.
