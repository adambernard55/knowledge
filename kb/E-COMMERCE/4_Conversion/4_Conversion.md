# Conversion Module Index

## Overview

The Conversion module addresses the most commercially consequential stage of the e-commerce customer journey: the transition from demonstrated interest to completed transaction. Every document in this module targets a specific domain where AI produces measurable impact on purchase completion rates, revenue protection, and operational efficiency.

The module spans five interconnected concerns. **Conversion rate optimization** applies predictive engagement scoring, behavioral intervention triggers, and advanced testing methodologies to increase the probability that an engaged visitor becomes a buyer. **Cart abandonment recovery** deploys AI to predict abandonment risk before it materializes and to orchestrate personalized multi-channel recovery when abandonment occurs. **Dynamic pricing and inventory management** use AI to set prices that align with strategic objectives --- revenue maximization, margin optimization, market share growth, or stock liquidation --- while demand forecasting ensures product availability without excess capital commitment. **Checkout optimization** removes friction from the final purchase steps through intelligent form filling, adaptive flows, and personalized option presentation. **Payment security** protects both customer and business through behavioral biometrics, transaction anomaly detection, and machine learning risk scoring that balance fraud prevention rigor against false positive rates.

Across all documents, the **SMART** framework governs goal definition and the **STRIVE** framework governs tool evaluation, with particular emphasis on the Ethical dimension: pricing fairness, data privacy, fraud detection bias, and accessibility. Each document is designed to stand alone as a complete reference while contributing to a coherent operational picture of AI-driven conversion strategy.
