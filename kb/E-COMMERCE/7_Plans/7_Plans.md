# Capstone Planning

This module provides the synthesis layer for the E-commerce AI knowledge base: structured methodologies for developing a strategic AI action plan that applies the SMART and STRIVE frameworks to real business scenarios. The two documents work in sequence — the capstone project establishes the analytical methodology, and the action plan template provides the comprehensive assessment structure.

## Module Contents

| ECOM-04 | [[capstone-project-strategic-ai-action\|Capstone Project: Strategic AI Action Plan]] | Step-by-step methodology for developing an AI-powered e-commerce strategy, applying SMART goal-setting and STRIVE evaluation to a chosen business scenario |
| ECOM-08 | [[Strategic AI E-commerce Action Plan\|Strategic AI E-commerce Action Plan]] | Comprehensive action plan template with scenario-based evaluation, implementation roadmap, and strategy validation frameworks |

## Reading Sequence
