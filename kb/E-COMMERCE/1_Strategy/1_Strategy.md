# Strategy Module — AI-Powered E-commerce

## Overview

The Strategy module establishes the intellectual foundation for every AI initiative in the e-commerce knowledge base. Documents in this module move through a deliberate progression: from understanding the core AI technologies that power modern e-commerce, through frameworks for evaluating and selecting tools, to the construction of a complete implementation strategy with ethical governance built in. Each reference document is designed to stand alone while contributing to a coherent strategic arc. Readers building an AI-powered e-commerce operation from scratch should work through these documents in sequence; those addressing a specific question — tool selection, discovery tactics, scaling methodology — can navigate directly to the relevant file.

## Reading Sequence

**For a complete strategic foundation:** ECOM-02 → ECOM-03 → ECOM-09 → ECOM-07. This sequence moves from foundational AI knowledge, through discovery-phase tactics and tool selection methodology, to full implementation planning and scaling.

**For tool selection only:** Start with ECOM-09 (STRIVE framework), then reference ECOM-02 for technical context on specific AI capabilities.

**For implementation and governance:** ECOM-07 is the primary document, with ECOM-09 supporting tool evaluation decisions within the broader strategy.
