# Engagement Module Index

## Overview

The Engagement module addresses the critical inflection point in the e-commerce funnel: the visitor is on-site, and every interaction either advances them toward conversion or accelerates their departure. This module provides strategic frameworks for deploying AI across four interconnected engagement domains -- product recommendations, dynamic website personalization, intelligent site search, and conversational AI. Each domain operates independently but delivers compounding returns when orchestrated as a unified personalization system. The governing principle across all documents is that AI engagement tools must be selected against measurable business objectives (SMART goals) and evaluated through a structured criteria framework (STRIVE) that balances technical capability, ROI, integration feasibility, and ethical compliance.

Effective on-site engagement is not a feature deployment exercise. It is a continuous optimization discipline. Recommendation algorithms must be tuned against conversion data. Personalization rules must be A/B tested against control experiences. Search relevance must be measured through query-to-purchase attribution. Chatbot flows must be audited for resolution quality, not just deflection volume. The documents in this module provide the strategic scaffolding for building, measuring, and iterating on AI-driven engagement systems that produce durable competitive advantage.

## Module Documents

| File | ID | Title | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `3_e-commerce-ai-strategic-personalization.md` | ECOM-06 | AI for Strategic On-Site Personalization & Engagement | Consolidated strategic reference covering the full personalization stack: recommendation engines, dynamic content, search, visual search, and conversational AI. Provides the module-level strategic framework and SMART/STRIVE application guidance. |
| `3_1_AI-Powered Product Recommendation Engines.md` | ECOM-12 | AI-Powered Product Recommendation Engines | Deep-dive into recommendation algorithm types (collaborative filtering, content-based, hybrid), cold-start mitigation, placement strategy across touchpoints, recommendation type taxonomy aligned to business goals, and performance measurement frameworks. |
| `3_2_Strategic Dynamic Website Personalization & Optimized Search.md` | ECOM-13 | Strategic Dynamic Website Personalization & Optimized Search | Covers AI-driven dynamic personalization of homepage, category pages, navigation, CTAs, and content alongside AI-powered site search (semantic search, personalized ranking, visual search, zero-result mitigation) and search query data as strategic intelligence. |
| `3_3_Conversational AI Strategy.md` | ECOM-14 | Conversational AI Strategy for E-Commerce | Strategic framework for chatbot deployment covering guided selling, proactive behavioral intervention, routine inquiry automation, lead capture, post-purchase engagement, system integration architecture, and ethical deployment requirements. |

## Navigation Guide

**Starting point:** Begin with `3_e-commerce-ai-strategic-personalization.md` (ECOM-06) for the consolidated strategic overview of all engagement domains. This document provides the conceptual foundation and module-level framework.

**Deep dives:** Each subsequent document (ECOM-12 through ECOM-14) expands a specific domain with detailed implementation guidance, evaluation criteria, and measurement frameworks. These documents are designed to stand alone -- any single reference can be consulted independently without requiring the others for context.

**Cross-references:** All documents in this module share the SMART goal-setting and STRIVE evaluation methodologies. Strategies developed in one domain (e.g., recommendation engine selection) should be validated against integration requirements documented in sibling files (e.g., chatbot integration architecture, search system connectivity).
