# Strategy & Application

Where theory meets execution. This section transforms conceptual understanding into actionable frameworks and real-world implementations.

While **Core Concepts** explains *what* AI knowledge systems are and *why* they matter, **Strategy & Application** focuses on *how* to build, deploy, and optimize them. Here you'll find comprehensive guides for designing agent knowledge bases, leveraging AI for SEO, maintaining data freshness, and implementing complete end-to-end workflows.

Each document provides battle-tested methodologies, architectural patterns, and practical examples you can adapt to your specific needs—whether you're building your first knowledge base or scaling an enterprise AI system.
