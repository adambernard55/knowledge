# ⚙️ CORE: Engine Architecture & Foundational Concepts

Welcome to the central repository for the foundational documents that define the **Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE)**. This section contains the technical and strategic pillars that explain how the SIE's knowledge base (the **Master Hub**) is constructed, maintained, and activated.

These documents serve as the primary reference for understanding the "what, why, and how" behind the engine that transforms scattered information into a living, intelligent asset.

## Core Concepts

This section details the technical building blocks and fundamental techniques that power the SIE's ability to understand and process information.

## Contents

- **[[kb/CORE/00_CORE|00 Core]]**
- **[[kb/CORE/1_core-concepts/index|Core Concepts]]** — The Knowledge Core is the central nervous system of the SIE, designed to minimize the 'Human Correction Tax' by providing a governed, single source of truth. It contains structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (including negative examples). It is operationalized via the Knowledge Pipeline (KPL), which syncs Obsidian markdown to a vector database for RAG, enabling the 'Fleet Commander' model of agent orchestration.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[00_anatomy]]                            | Defines the architecture and components of the knowledge base (the Master Hub) that powers the Strategic Intelligence Engine's (SIE) agents, enabling them to perform complex reasoning and automated tasks with high accuracy and context.     |
| [[02_model-context-protocol-mcp]]         | Defines the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an emerging standard for how AI agents connect to and retrieve information from knowledge sources, tools, and other agents, ensuring interoperability and scalability for the SIE.                  |
| [[03_advanced-retrieval-techniques]]      | Explores advanced methods beyond standard RAG for providing AI agents with precise, governed, and contextually-aware information from a knowledge base, enhancing their reasoning and decision-making capabilities.                             |
| [[04_the-data-moat]]                      | Defines a 'Data Moat' as a defensible competitive advantage built from proprietary data, and explains how the Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE) is designed to construct and activate this critical asset for clients.                        |
| [[05_retrieval-augmented-generation-rag]] | Explains Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the core technique used by the Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE) to provide agents with real-time, factual context from the Master Hub, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of their outputs. |
| [[06_vector-databases]]                   | Explains what Vector Databases are and their critical role in enabling semantic search for the SIE's RAG pipelines, allowing agents to find information based on meaning rather than keywords.                                                  |
