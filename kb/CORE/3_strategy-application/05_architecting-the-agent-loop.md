semantic_summary: >
  The Agent Loop is the autonomous execution layer of the Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE), built using frameworks like CrewAI. It orchestrates specialized agents (Analyst, Editor, Research) using a hybrid reasoning architecture that combines standard RAG, fine-tuned models, and MCP-enabled domain experts. All agent outputs are governed by hardcoded integrity protocols and delivered to a landing zone for Fleet Commander triage.

# Architecting the Agent Loop

The **Agent Loop** is the autonomous execution layer of the Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE). While the Knowledge Pipeline (KPL) governs the data, the Agent Loop is the "engine" that acts upon the Knowledge Core [1] 

It is an **Axiomatic** principle of the SIE that autonomous execution must be verifiable. The Agent Loop achieves this by orchestrating specialized AI agents (built using frameworks like CrewAI) to perform complex workflows under a set of non-negotiable, hardcoded integrity protocols [2] This architecture shifts the human operator from a tactical micromanager to a strategic Fleet Commander.

## The Agentic Feedback Cycle

Every agent within the loop operates on a continuous, closed feedback cycle designed to minimize errors and encourage self-correction. This cycle consists of three distinct phases [3]:

1. **Gather Context:** The agent collects relevant data from the Knowledge Core using vector search, semantic retrieval, or API calls via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
2. **Take Action:** The agent executes its reasoning and compute tasks, utilizing specific tools (e.g., running bash scripts, generating code, or drafting content).
3. **Verify Work:** The agent evaluates its own output against the system's schema and rules before finalizing the task.

## Hybrid Reasoning Architecture (Phase 3A)

To achieve enterprise-grade reliability, the SIE employs a **Hybrid Reasoning Architecture**. This approach recognizes that a single, general-purpose LLM is insufficient for complex, multi-step business processes. 

The architecture divides cognitive labor among specialized components [4]:

- **The General Contractor (Agentic Workflow/RAG):** The primary agent manages the complex, multi-step task, uses tools, and orchestrates the overall workflow.
- **The Domain Expert (MCP Model):** An agent equipped with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that possesses deep, holistic knowledge of the entire Knowledge Core. For example, an Analyst Agent uses MCP to identify critical thematic gaps across hundreds of documents rather than relying on a simple similarity search.
- **The Master Craftsman (Fine-Tuned Model):** A model trained to perfect a specific skill or style. For instance, an Editor Agent delegates the final writing task to a fine-tuned "Brand Voice" model to ensure stylistic perfection.

## Orchestrating Specialized Agents

The Agent Loop relies on a crew of specialized agents, each with a distinct role, backstory, and toolset. 

- **The Research Agent:** Tasked with gathering external data and monitoring competitor movements.
- **The Analyst Agent:** Responsible for synthesizing raw data, identifying strategic gaps in the Knowledge Core, and structuring information.
- **The Editor Agent:** Focused on content creation, schema enforcement, and brand voice alignment.

When a trigger occurs (e.g., a "Content Watchdog" flags an article as stale), the Analyst Agent queries the MCP model for context and passes a detailed update brief to the Editor Agent, who then executes the rewrite using a fine-tuned model [4]

## Integration with the Intelligence Protocol

The Agent Loop does not publish directly to the live Knowledge Core. To maintain the integrity of the system and reduce the Human Correction Tax, all agent outputs must pass through the **Intelligence Lifecycle** [5]

1. **The Landing Zone:** When an agent completes a task, it delivers the raw output (e.g., a markdown document or JSON data) to a designated temporary "landing zone" or inbox.
2. **Protocol Enforcement:** The output must include a Verification Ledger, as mandated by the Iron Word Verification Loop, detailing the agent's confidence score, reasoning, and sources used [1]
3. **Fleet Commander Triage:** The human operator reviews the ledger in the landing zone. If the output is verified, it is approved, structured according to the `03_schema`, and permanently integrated into the Knowledge Core.

By strictly separating the execution layer (Agent Loop) from the canonical data layer (Knowledge Core) via this triage process, the SIE ensures that autonomous agents enhance, rather than dilute, the strategic value of the business's intelligence assets.
