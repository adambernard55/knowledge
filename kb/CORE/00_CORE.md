# Core

The CORE section serves as the architectural blueprint and strategic foundation for the entire **Strategic Intelligence Engine (SIE)**. It contains the essential documents that define the "what, why, and how" behind the system, detailing both the technical components and the high-level principles that guide its operation.

This category is divided into two primary areas:

1. **Core Concepts:** This area focuses on the technical engine room of the SIE, explaining the fundamental building blocks and protocols. It covers critical technologies like [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](app://obsidian.md/04_retrieval-augmented-generation-rag), the role of [Vector Databases](app://obsidian.md/05_vector-databases) in enabling semantic search, and the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](app://obsidian.md/01_model-context-protocol-mcp) that governs how AI agents interact with the knowledge base.
    
2. **Strategy & Application:** This area bridges the gap between technology and business value. It outlines how the core concepts are applied to create a defensible competitive advantage, such as building a [Data Moat](app://obsidian.md/03_the-data-moat) from proprietary information.
    

In essence, the CORE section is the master reference for understanding how the SIE is constructed, maintained, and activated to transform scattered information into a living, intelligent asset.
