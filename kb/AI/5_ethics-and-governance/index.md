## Contents

- **[[00_responsible-ai-principles.md|Responsible AI Principles]]** — A practical, organization-wide set of principles and guardrails for building and using AI responsibly—covering safety, privacy, fairness, transparency, human oversight, security, IP, and operational excellence.
- **[[01_data-privacy-and-compliance|Data Privacy and Compliance in AI Systems]]** — A practical reference on how to design and operate AI systems that respect data privacy and comply with major regulations—covering data types, legal bases, data minimization, security, cross-border transfers, and governance.
- **[[02_bias-and-fairness|Bias and Fairness in AI Systems]]** — A practical reference on how bias arises in AI systems, how it impacts people and organizations, and how to design, evaluate, and operate AI models and workflows to support fair and responsible outcomes.
- **[[03_transparency-and-accountability|Transparency and Accountability in AI Systems]]** — A practical reference on how to design and operate AI systems that are transparent, explainable, and accountable—so people, regulators, and organizations can understand how AI is used, how decisions are made, and who is responsible when things go wrong.
- **[[04_intellectual-property|Intellectual Property in the Age of AI]]** — A practical reference on how intellectual property works with AI systems—covering training data, model outputs, copyright, licensing, and safe commercial use of AI-generated content.
- **[[05_human-ai-collaboration|Human–AI Collaboration]]** — A practical reference on how humans and AI should work together—defining roles, designing human-in-the-loop workflows, and ensuring that AI augments rather than replaces human judgment, creativity, and accountability.
- **[[06_ethical-considerations-in-ai-marketing|Ethical Considerations in AI Marketing]]** — A practical reference on how to use AI in marketing responsibly, covering data privacy, security, algorithmic bias, and ethical data handling practices that go beyond compliance to build long-term trust.
- **[[07_operational-excellent|Operational Excellence for Successful AI Adoption]]** — Operational excellence is the missing link between AI’s technical capability and real business impact. This reference explains why operational readiness—clear workflows, documentation, collaboration, and change management—is a prerequisite for successful AI adoption and sustained P&L results.
- **[[08_agentic-ai-safety-and-security-playbook|Deploying Agentic AI with Safety and Security (Playbook)]]** — A practical playbook for deploying autonomous AI agents safely—covering agent-specific risk drivers, governance, traceability, IAM, inter-agent security, and contingency planning.
