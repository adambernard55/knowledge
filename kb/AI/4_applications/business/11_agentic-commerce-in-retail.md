# The Rise of Agentic Commerce in Retail

The retail and e-commerce industries are undergoing a fundamental transformation, moving beyond simple digital interactions into the era of **agentic commerce**. This paradigm shift involves deploying autonomous AI agents capable of executing complex, multi-step actions across the entire consumer lifecycle, from initial discovery to post-purchase support.

These agents are not merely chatbots answering questions; they are designed to independently plan, reason, and act on behalf of the business to create a proactive and deeply personalized shopping experience.

## Core Technology: Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience (CX)

Google Cloud is a key driver of this shift with its **Gemini Enterprise for CX** platform. This solution is designed to merge shopping and customer service into a single, intelligent, agentic system powered by advanced Gemini models.

Key capabilities include:

-   **Pre-built & Configurable Agents:** Allows for rapid deployment of agents that can manage the entire customer lifecycle.
-   **Shopping Agent:** Acts as a proactive digital concierge, using multimodal capabilities (text, voice, image) to autonomously build carts and execute consented actions. This moves beyond reactive recommendations to true hyper-personalization [1]
-   **Conversational Shopping:** Enables natural language ordering and interaction across various platforms (mobile, kiosk, in-car), with intelligent upselling and real-time data synchronization [1]
-   **Agent Studio:** Provides tools for businesses to build and scale 24/7 active problem-solving agents, while also offering AI-driven guidance to human representatives.

## Real-World Applications & Case Studies

Leading global retailers are already implementing agentic commerce strategies to drive measurable business value and achieve significant ROI.

### The Home Depot: The "AI-First" Interconnected Store

The Home Depot is expanding its partnership with Google Cloud to create an agentic retail experience powered by Gemini models.
-   **Magic Apron Agent:** An advanced agent offering conversational project planning localized to the store level, providing precise aisle-level navigation and product knowledge.
-   **Pro Contractor Tools:** AI-powered generation of materials lists for professional contractors.
-   **Associate Enablement:** Equipping thousands of store associates with Gemini Enterprise tools to streamline complex workflows and improve customer service.

### Authentic Brands Group: Supercharging Creativity and ROAS

Authentic, owner of over 50 brands like Reebok and Juicy Couture, launched its "Authentic Intelligence" platform using Google Cloud's media models (Imagen 3, Veo 3.1).
-   **Specialized AI Agents:** Over 15 agents are used across the organization for tasks ranging from business development to high-end campaign conceptualization.
-   **Measurable Impact:** In early tests, ad creative for Reebok enhanced by these agents delivered up to a **60% higher return on ad spend (ROAS)** compared to traditional imagery.

### The Estée Lauder Companies (Jo Malone London): AI Scent Advisor

Jo Malone London built a sophisticated conversational agent to recreate its signature in-store consultation in the digital realm.
-   **Personalized Recommendations:** The agent uses Vertex AI and Gemini to understand a customer's natural language descriptions of scents, mapping their preferences to complex olfactory data.
-   **Business Goal:** The agent provides bespoke, expert-informed recommendations, moving a shopper from curiosity to a confident purchase.

### Other Leading Retailers

-   **Gap Inc.:** Plans to use AI tools across its brand portfolio (Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, Athleta) to create a unified, AI-powered platform for product creation, customer experience, and employee enablement.
-   **Honeywell:** Developed a Smart Shopping Platform with Google Cloud that uses Gemini to provide retailers with real-time insights into in-store compliance, inventory accuracy, and associate productivity.
-   **Kroger, Lowe’s, Papa John’s, and Woolworths:** Are all using Gemini Enterprise for CX to deliver elevated and personalized customer experiences.

## Strategic Implications

The move to agentic commerce represents a strategic necessity for thriving in the modern retail landscape. It is no longer about simply being more efficient; it is about using autonomous systems to find the right customers, create seamless and personalized journeys, and automate complex workflows to drive measurable business value [1] By turning fragmented digital and in-store engagements into a single, effortless experience, retailers can gain a significant competitive advantage.
