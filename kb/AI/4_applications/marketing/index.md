The AI Applications Marketing category serves as a comprehensive knowledge base on the strategic and practical application of Artificial Intelligence in marketing.

The collection begins with a foundational document, [00_foundations-of-ai-powered-marketing](obsidian://open?file=kb%2FAI%2F4_applications%2Fmarketing%2F00_foundations-of-ai-powered-marketing.md), which outlines core AI concepts, strategic advantages, and ethical principles. It then delves into specific, high-impact applications:

- **Implementation Frameworks:** [03_applied-ai-marketing](obsidian://open?file=kb%2FAI%2F4_applications%2Fmarketing%2F03_applied-ai-marketing.md) provides a hands-on guide to implementation with frameworks and ROI tracking, complemented by the [04_gen-ai-playbook](obsidian://open?file=kb%2FAI%2F4_applications%2Fmarketing%2F04_gen-ai-playbook.md), which offers a strategic matrix for guiding organizational adoption of Generative AI.
- **Practical Tools and Advanced Concepts:** The folder includes actionable resources like [05_chatgpt-prompts](obsidian://open?file=kb%2FAI%2F4_applications%2Fmarketing%2F05_chatgpt-prompts.md) for daily tasks and introduces the forward-looking strategy of [Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)](app://obsidian.md/kb/AI/4_applications/marketing/06_optimizing-for-ai-citation-GEO).
