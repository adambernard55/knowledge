- **[[2_concepts-and-techniques/index|Concepts And Techniques]]** — This document details the architecture for a deep research system, an advanced agentic workflow that surpasses standard RAG. It explains the roles of an orchestrator LLM and specialized sub-agents in planning, executing, and synthesizing research from large document corpora, providing a framework for answering complex, multi-source queries.
- **[[3_evaluation-and-tooling/index|Evaluation And Tooling]]** — This document provides a foundational overview of the 2026 landscape for AI evaluation and tooling. It covers the bifurcation of evaluation and observability platforms, the rise of LLM-as-a-judge methodologies, advanced benchmarks, agentic tooling, and the critical role of AI FinOps and compliance. It acts as a gateway to more detailed guides.
