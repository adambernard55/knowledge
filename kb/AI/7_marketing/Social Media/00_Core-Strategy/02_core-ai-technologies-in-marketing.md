## 1. Machine Learning (ML) & Predictive Analytics

**Definition:** Algorithms that learn from datasets to make predictions, classify data, and segment audiences without explicit programming for every rule.

**Social Media Applications:**
*   **Predictive Performance:** Forecasting engagement rates and virality before content publication.
*   **Hyper-Segmentation:** Grouping audiences based on behavioral patterns and predicted future intent (e.g., likelihood to purchase).
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjusting offers in real-time based on demand signals in social commerce.
*   **Churn Prediction:** Identifying users exhibiting disengagement behaviors to trigger retention campaigns.

## 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Definition:** Technology enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Includes Transformer models (BERT, GPT).

**Social Media Applications:**
*   **Advanced Sentiment Analysis:** Detecting nuanced emotions (sarcasm, frustration, delight) beyond simple positive/negative binary.
*   **Intent Classification:** Distinguishing between a support query, a purchase signal, or a feature request.
*   **Content Generation:** Drafting captions, summarizing community discussions, and adapting tone for different platforms.
*   **Crisis Detection:** Monitoring real-time discourse to identify early warning signs of brand reputation threats.

## 3. Computer Vision (CV)

**Definition:** The ability of machines to "see" and interpret visual information from images and videos.

**Social Media Applications:**
*   **Visual Listening:** Identifying brand logos or products in User Generated Content (UGC) where the brand is not explicitly mentioned in text.
*   **Trend Forecasting:** Analyzing aesthetic trends (colors, composition) gaining traction across millions of images.
*   **Accessibility:** Automatically generating descriptive alt-text for visually impaired users.
*   **Content Moderation:** Automatically flagging inappropriate visual content before it is published.
