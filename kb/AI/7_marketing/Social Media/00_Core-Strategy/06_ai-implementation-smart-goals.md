## 1. Barriers to Adoption
Successful implementation requires anticipating common hurdles:
*   **Data Silos:** Isolated data repositories prevent AI from learning effectively.
*   **Skill Gaps:** Teams may lack the literacy to prompt, evaluate, or manage AI tools.
*   **Trust Deficit:** Internal skepticism regarding AI reliability or job security.

## 2. The SMART Framework for AI
AI initiatives must be grounded in measurable business objectives.

*   **Specific:** Define the exact use case (e.g., "Use NLP for sentiment analysis on Twitter").
*   **Measurable:** Define the metric (e.g., "Reduce response time by 20%").
*   **Achievable:** Ensure data and resources are available.
*   **Relevant:** Align with the broader marketing strategy.
*   **Time-bound:** Set a pilot duration (e.g., "Within Q3").

## 3. Example Implementation
**Scenario:** Implementing an AI Social Listening Tool.

*   **Goal:** "Implement [Tool Name] to analyze customer sentiment regarding our new product launch."
*   **Metric:** "Identify top 3 pain points and increase positive sentiment by 10% via proactive engagement."
*   **Timeline:** "Complete setup by Week 2; Full report by Week 6."

## 4. Continuous Learning Loop
AI models and strategies degrade without maintenance.
1.  **Deploy:** Launch the pilot.
2.  **Measure:** Compare against SMART benchmarks.
3.  **Refine:** Retrain the model or adjust the prompt engineering.
4.  **Scale:** Roll out to other departments or regions.
