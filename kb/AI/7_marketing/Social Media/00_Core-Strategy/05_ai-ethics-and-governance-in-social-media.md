## 1. Data Governance
Governance is the foundation of ethical AI. It requires clear protocols for:
*   **Accountability:** Who owns the data used to train models?
*   **Security:** Protocols for data breaches involving AI-processed information.
*   **Compliance:** Adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI regulations.

## 2. Algorithmic Transparency (XAI)
"Black box" AI presents a strategic risk.
*   **Explainability:** The ability to understand *why* an AI made a specific decision (e.g., ad targeting or content moderation).
*   **Auditability:** Mechanisms to review AI decisions for errors or bias.

## 3. Societal Impact & Responsibility
Brands must consider the externalities of their AI use:
*   **Filter Bubbles:** Personalization algorithms can inadvertently limit exposure to diverse perspectives.
*   **Bias:** AI can learn and amplify historical biases present in training data. Continuous auditing for fairness is required.
*   **Misinformation:** Safeguards must be in place to prevent the generation or amplification of false narratives.

## 4. Ethical AI by Design
Ethics cannot be an afterthought. It must be integrated into the procurement and deployment process (see **STRIVE Framework**). This aligns with the **"Unshakable Compass"** principle—prioritizing long-term integrity over short-term efficiency.
