## Overview

Recent global studies show that while nearly every organization is investing in Artificial Intelligence (AI), **only a small fraction—around 5%—are generating transformational value**.  

These “future-built” leaders are achieving measurable revenue growth, cost efficiency, and innovation advantages by embedding AI deeply across workflows, decision processes, and organizational strategy.

This reference summary outlines:

- The evidence behind the growing **AI value gap** between leaders and laggards;
- The defining characteristics of **AI value generators**;
- The role of **agentic AI** in accelerating this separation;
- A practical **framework** for organizations to close the gap and scale value responsibly.

## 1. The Emerging AI Value Divide

### 1.1 Most Companies Struggle to Capture Value

Although AI adoption has grown explosively, **60% of companies report minimal measurable value**, despite notable investments.  
Only a select 5%—the “future-built” cohort—have managed to scale AI initiatives enterprise-wide and integrate them into decision-making, product design, operations, and customer experiences.

These companies capture incremental and reinvested gains, creating a compounding effect that magnifies their lead each year.

### 1.2 Key Reasons for the Gap

1. **Leadership alignment:** lack of top-level sponsorship or strategic clarity.
2. **Fragmented execution:** numerous pilots without end-to-end workflow integration.
3. **Talent bottlenecks:** insufficient reskilling and AI fluency across teams.
4. **Poor data foundations:** siloed or ungoverned data infrastructure.
5. **Underpowered technology stack:** disconnected tools incapable of scaling.

In contrast, future‑built organizations **lead with vision, governance, and reinvestment**, making AI integral to both efficiency and innovation.

## 2. What Future‑Built Companies Do Differently

“Future-built” companies are defined by **five interlinked strategic pillars** that enable consistent AI value realization.

|Pillar|Description|
|---|---|
|**1. Multiyear Strategic Ambition**|Top‑down AI vision led by the board and CEO with dedicated budgets and KPIs tied to corporate growth.|
|**2. Workflow Reinvention**|Redesigning entire business processes—R&D, marketing, supply chain, HR—around AI augmentation rather than isolated automation.|
|**3. AI‑First Operating Model**|Building co‑ownership structures between IT and business units, where humans and AI collaborate through structured oversight.|
|**4. Talent and Upskilling**|Systematic training, recruitment, and engagement programs ensuring more than 50% of the workforce is AI‑literate.|
|**5. Fit‑for‑Purpose Tech and Data**|A modular, interoperable AI architecture leveraging reusable models, governed data, and agent platforms.|

Collectively, these principles create a **sustainable multiplier effect**, enabling accelerated growth, faster innovation, and measurable ROI.

## 3. The Expanding Value Gap

### 3.1 Financial Outperformance

Future-built leaders consistently outperform their peers:

- **~1.7× higher revenue growth**
- **~1.6× higher EBIT margins**
- **~3× higher shareholder returns**

These outcomes stem from clear prioritization and reinvestment of AI-derived gains into **further capability development**.

### 3.2 The Compounding Cycle

Leading firms adopt an iterative cycle:

1. Deploy focused AI initiatives tied to strategic metrics.
2. Measure realized gains in cost savings or new revenue.
3. Reinvest those gains into infrastructure, skills, and agentic capabilities.
4. Expand AI’s role into new workflows and markets.

This feedback loop amplifies organizational learning and technological sophistication—widening the gap between leaders and laggards.

---

## 4. Where the Value Concentrates

Research indicates that **approximately 70% of measurable AI value emerges from core business functions**, not peripheral tasks.

|Function|Share of Total AI Value (Est. 2025)|Nature of Gains|
|---|---|---|
|**Sales & Marketing**|20–25%|Personalization, demand forecasting, lead scoring|
|**R&D and Product Innovation**|15%|Faster iterations, predictive testing|
|**Manufacturing & Supply**|15–20%|Predictive maintenance, optimization|
|**IT & Infrastructure**|13%|Automation, monitoring, orchestration|
|**Support Functions (HR, Finance, Legal)**|10–15%|Routine task automation, compliance support|

The pattern emphasizes that **value accrues where AI integrates with decision‑rich, data‑dense workflows**—especially customer and product‑facing activities.

## 5. The Rise of Agentic AI

### 5.1 Defining Agentic AI

**Agentic AI** merges predictive and generative capabilities to observe, reason, and act autonomously within workflows.  
Unlike traditional generative models, agents execute multistep processes, communicate with systems, and coordinate across tools—with human oversight.

Agentic systems are thus the **“digital co‑workers”** of modern enterprises.

### 5.2 Rapid Growth of Agentic Value

- Agents represent **~17% of total AI business value in 2025**, projected to reach **~30% by 2028**.
- **Future-built** companies allocate ~15% of AI budgets to agentic capabilities and are **three times more likely** to deploy functioning agents at scale.

The practical impact includes:

- End‑to‑end process automation (e.g., supply chain orchestration).
- Real‑time personalization (e.g., virtual product advisors).
- Knowledge retrieval and recommendation (e.g., customer service copilots).

Agentic AI thus acts as a **value accelerator**, compounding returns and heightening competitive disparity.

## 6. Sector and Regional Variation

|Leading Sectors|Characteristics|
|---|---|
|**Software & Telecommunications**|Highest maturity; 70–80% AI usage in core workflows.|
|**Payments & Fintech**|Strong AI investment in fraud detection and personalization.|
|**Manufacturing & Energy**|Rapid adoption of predictive maintenance agents.|
|**Consumer Goods & Retail**|Emerging leader in generative marketing applications.|

|Leading Regions|Traits|
|---|---|
|**North America**|Highest agent adoption (≈50%).|
|**Asia‑Pacific**|Largest relative AI budget (≈5.2% of total IT spend).|
|**Europe**|Moderate adoption, high governance focus.|

While access to tools is improving globally, **AI literacy and upskilling rates remain inconsistent**, influencing the pace of value realization.

## 7. Building an AI‑First Organization

AI transformation requires systematic redesign—not just pilot projects or tool adoption.

### 7.1 Organizational Enablers

- **Executive Sponsorship:** visible C‑suite accountability; nearly all top performers have Chief AI or Chief Data Officers.
- **Joint Ownership:** shared governance between IT and business teams; elimination of “shadow AI” efforts.
- **Responsible AI Governance:** enterprise‑wide policies ensuring transparency, fairness, and security.
- **Cross‑functional Co‑design:** human/AI teams collaboratively redesign workflows instead of layering tech onto legacy systems.

### 7.2 People and Skills Dimension

- **Broad Upskilling:** more than half of corporate staff trained in AI tools or data literacy.
- **Hybrid Work Design:** rational redivision of labor between humans and agents.
- **Cultural Readiness:** encouraging experimentation under ethical guardrails.

In this “human‑plus‑machine” model, **humans remain orchestrators of AI capability**, ensuring accountability and creativity.
