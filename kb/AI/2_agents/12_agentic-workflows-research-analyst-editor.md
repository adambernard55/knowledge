# Agentic Workflows: How Research, Analyst, and Editor Agents Collaborate

Agentic workflows are structured, multi-step processes where specialized AI agents work together to move from a question to a high-confidence, publishable outcome. Instead of relying on a single generalist system, an agentic approach assigns distinct responsibilities—research, analysis, and editorial quality control—so each step is executed with focus and traceability. The result is a repeatable production line for strategic intelligence: insights that are evidence-informed, decision-oriented, and ready to share with stakeholders.

## Introduction to Agentic Workflows

At their core, agentic workflows are about decomposition. Complex work—like producing intelligence briefs, market analyses, or executive-ready memos—is broken into stages that mirror how high-performing human teams operate. Each agent receives a narrow mandate, clear inputs, and defined outputs. This reduces noise, prevents premature conclusions, and makes it easier to validate quality at each handoff. When designed well, the workflow scales: you can add more sources, increase analytical rigor, or tighten editorial governance without rewriting the entire process.

## The role of the Research Agent

The Research Agent is responsible for gathering and organizing raw material. This includes identifying relevant sources, extracting key facts, capturing quotations, and logging provenance so claims can be traced back to evidence. In an intelligence context, the Research Agent also flags uncertainty—conflicting reports, outdated figures, or missing context—and separates signal from background noise. The output is not an opinion; it is a structured research pack designed for downstream reasoning.

## The role of the Analyst Agent

The Analyst Agent transforms research into meaning. Using the research pack as input, it identifies patterns, develops hypotheses, evaluates scenarios, and clarifies implications for a specific decision or audience. Good analysis explicitly distinguishes between _what is known_, _what is inferred_, and _what remains unknown_. It may also stress-test assumptions, compare alternatives, and quantify confidence levels. This is where strategic intelligence is formed—turning information into actionable judgment.

## The role of the Editor Agent

The Editor Agent ensures the final output is publishable and governed. It checks structure, coherence, and readability; removes redundancy; and enforces style guidelines. More importantly, the Editor Agent verifies that claims match the provided evidence, that caveats are clearly stated, and that the narrative aligns with the intended purpose. If the Analyst Agent answers “so what?”, the Editor Agent ensures the audience can absorb it quickly and trust what they read.

## How they collaborate in a crew to create strategic intelligence

In a well-run crew, collaboration is a disciplined loop: the Research Agent supplies evidence, the Analyst Agent produces interpretations and recommendations, and the Editor Agent refines and validates the deliverable. When gaps appear—missing data, unclear logic, or unsupported claims—the Editor or Analyst routes questions back to Research, creating a feedback cycle that improves both accuracy and clarity. Over time, teams can standardize prompts, templates, and quality checks to deepen consistency and increase throughput.

Agentic workflows become even more powerful when paired with strong knowledge design—how concepts are defined, how evidence is stored, and how outputs connect across a body of work. This is where methods like semantic modeling and reusable knowledge structures help crews produce intelligence that is not only correct today, but compounding over time.
