# [[Arc Search]]

## What It Is
Arc Search is an AI-first web browser and search engine created by The Browser Company. Designed for the modern internet, it combines browsing, search, and summarization in one experience. Instead of showing a page of links, Arc Search can instantly generate an **AI summary** of your query ("Browse for Me"), pulling verified insights from trusted sources.

## Key Features
- **AI Summarization ("Browse for Me"):** Instantly compiles key takeaways from multiple sources into a clean, summarized page.
- **Unified Browser and Search Engine:** Seamlessly integrates browsing and AI-driven search without third-party clutter.
- **Privacy-Focused:** Limits tracking and ad clutter to deliver a distraction-free research environment.
- **Fast, Minimalist Interface:** Prioritizes speed, readability, and elegant design across devices.
- **Integration with Arc Browser:** Works natively with The Browser Company’s flagship Arc Browser for a unified workflow.

## Use Cases
- **Quick Research:** Instantly summarize web topics and sources for faster comprehension.
- **Productivity & Focus:** Reduce tab overload by replacing multiple open pages with a concise summary.
- **Content Ideation:** Gather insights and outline ideas from multiple credible sources in one view.
- **Private Searching:** Explore topics without ad trackers or intrusive data collection.

## Pricing
- **Free:** Arc Search is currently free to use. Arc Browser integration is also available at no cost.

## Expert Notes
Arc Search builds on the trend of AI-powered retrieval seen in tools like [[Perplexity]], but with a design-forward browser experience. It simplifies the research process by merging **browsing**, **search**, and **AI summarization**, making it ideal for users who value both speed and clean interface design.
