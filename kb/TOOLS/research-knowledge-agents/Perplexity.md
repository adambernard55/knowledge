## What It Is
Perplexity is a conversational answer engine that uses large language models to deliver accurate and comprehensive answers to user queries. Unlike traditional search engines that provide a list of links, Perplexity synthesizes information from multiple sources and presents it as a direct, well-cited answer.

## Key Features
- **Cited Sources:** Every answer includes inline citations, allowing users to verify the information and explore sources directly.
- **Conversational Follow-ups:** Users can ask follow-up questions to refine their search and dive deeper into topics.
- **Focus Modes:** Allows users to narrow their search to specific domains like academic papers, YouTube, or Reddit.
- **Collections:** Users can organize their research threads into collections for later reference.

## Use Cases
- **Academic Research:** Quickly finding and summarizing information from scientific papers.
- **Everyday Questions:** Getting direct, synthesized answers without having to click through multiple ad-filled websites.
- **Content Creation:** Gathering initial research and sources for a blog post or article.
