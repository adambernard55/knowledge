## What It Is
Elicit is an AI-powered research assistant designed to streamline the process of reviewing, summarizing, and synthesizing academic literature. Created by Ought, Elicit helps researchers automate repetitive parts of evidence synthesis — such as finding relevant papers, summarizing results, extracting data, and organizing insights. Unlike standard search engines, Elicit structures information from research papers into easy-to-analyze formats.

## Key Features
- **Automated Literature Review:** Searches for papers relevant to your research question and highlights key findings without manual screening.  
- **Research Question Builder:** Guides users to refine queries into effective research questions suited for academic discovery.  
- **Paper Summaries:** Generates structured summaries and highlights of papers, including methods, participants, and outcomes.  
- **Data Extraction:** Automatically extracts quantitative and qualitative results from PDFs or research abstracts.  
- **Structured Tables:** Organizes extracted data into visual tables for easier comparison across studies.  
- **Custom Workflow Design:** Users can create custom workflows for tasks like summarizing abstracts, comparing study designs, or aggregating results.  
- **Citation Tracking:** Links results to source material for transparent verifiability.

## Use Cases
- **Systematic Literature Review:** Rapidly gather and summarize peer-reviewed studies for academic or policy research.  
- **Research Paper Summarization:** Digest lengthy academic papers into key insights with method and conclusion summaries.  
- **Evidence Synthesis:** Collect structured findings across multiple sources to identify consensus, gaps, and trends.  
- **Policy and Decision Support:** Provide evidence-based insights for organizations or government research tasks.  
- **Academic Writing:** Extract and organize references or supportive material for a new paper or review.

## Pricing
- **Free Plan:** Basic paper search and summary capabilities.  
- **Pro Plan:** Advanced extraction, workflow customization, and export features (pricing varies, typically from \$10–\$25/month).  
- **Team / Institutional Plans:** Handles bulk research workflows and integrations for university or enterprise environments.

## Expert Notes
Elicit distinguishes itself from tools like [[Perplexity]] by focusing exclusively on **academic research synthesis** rather than general knowledge retrieval. Its biggest advantage is the ability to **structure unstructured research data**, making literature reviews dramatically faster and more systematic.  
For academics, policy analysts, and research writers, Elicit serves as a "co-pilot" for evidence gathering — automating the tedious parts of research while preserving human interpretation where it matters most.
