# [[Consensus]]

## What It Is
Consensus is an AI-powered research tool that instantly finds answers to questions from peer-reviewed scientific papers. It uses large language models and a curated database of academic literature to identify the prevailing “scientific consensus” on a given topic, making it a powerful companion for researchers, writers, and decision-makers.

## Key Features
- **Evidence-Based Summaries:** Summarizes findings directly from peer-reviewed sources, eliminating misinformation and non-scientific content.
- **Claim Verification:** Instead of relying on popular opinion, Consensus uses AI to identify whether scientific studies **support or refute** a specific claim.
- **Search Refinement Tools:** Users can filter by study type, quality, and publication date to focus on high-quality research.
- **Topic Insights:** Offers aggregated insights showing how many studies support or contradict a hypothesis.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Generates plain-language explanations from complex research papers, ideal for non-specialists.

## Use Cases
- **Academic Research:** Quickly identify what the scientific literature says about a hypothesis or topic.
- **Content Creation:** Support articles, blog posts, and reports with verifiable, peer-reviewed evidence.
- **Policy and Decision-Making:** Base recommendations or corporate decisions on the weight of scientific evidence.
- **Health & Wellness Research:** Evaluate claims and treatments with actual research backing.

## Pricing
- **Free Plan:** Basic search and limited summaries.
- **Pro Plan:** Unlocks unlimited searches, full summaries, and advanced filtering (typically around $19/month).
- **Team Plans:** For research groups or organizations that need shared access and collaboration tools.

## Expert Notes
Consensus differentiates itself from general-purpose LLMs and search engines like [[Perplexity]] by focusing solely on peer-reviewed evidence. Its greatest strength lies in **credibility** and **transparency**, presenting citations and study metadata for every claim. For anyone conducting literature reviews or producing research-backed content, Consensus provides an invaluable shortcut to legitimate, scientifically grounded information.
