**Descript**

Descript is an all-in-one audio and video editing platform that uses AI to make editing as simple as editing a text document. It automatically transcribes media, allowing users to edit audio/video by editing the text transcript. It also includes screen recording and AI voice generation features.

**Key Features:**

* Automatic transcription with high accuracy.  
* Text-based video and audio editing (cut, copy, paste text to edit media).  
* AI Overdub: Create a realistic clone of your voice to correct errors or add new audio.  
* Studio Sound: AI-powered noise reduction and audio enhancement.  
* Filler Word Removal (e.g., "um," "uh").  
* Screen and camera recording.  
* Multi-track audio editing.  
* Video effects and transitions.  
* Collaboration features.

**Marketing Use Cases:**

* Editing podcasts and interviews quickly by manipulating text.  
* Creating video tutorials and product demos (including screen recordings).  
* Repurposing webinar recordings into shorter video clips or audio snippets.  
* Generating accurate transcripts for videos (improves SEO and accessibility).  
* Correcting audio errors in voiceovers using Overdub without re-recording.  
* Cleaning up audio quality with Studio Sound for professional results.

**Pricing Overview:** Offers a Free tier with limited transcription hours and features. Paid plans (Creator, Pro, Enterprise) offer more transcription hours, watermark-free exports, Overdub, Studio Sound limits, and advanced features. Paid plans typically start around $12-$15/month per user when billed annually. *Subject to change; check website for current pricing.*

**Expert Notes & Tips:** Descript revolutionizes audio/video editing workflow, especially for dialogue-heavy content. The text-based editing is incredibly intuitive. Studio Sound works remarkably well for cleaning up noisy audio. Overdub requires initial voice training and consent; it's great for minor corrections. Transcription accuracy is high but always worth a quick review. Excellent tool for podcasters, video marketers, and course creators.
