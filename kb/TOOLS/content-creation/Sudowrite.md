# Sudowrite

**Sudowrite** is an AI-powered creative writing assistant designed specifically for fiction and storytelling. It helps authors overcome writer’s block, refine narrative style, and expand scenes using natural, contextual prompts. Unlike general-purpose AI tools, Sudowrite focuses entirely on the craft of creative writing—from worldbuilding and dialogue to style editing and sensory description.

Built by writers for writers, Sudowrite integrates seamlessly into the creative process, acting as a brainstorming partner and narrative enhancer rather than a replacement for authentic voice.

## **Key Features**

- **“Rewrite” Tool:** Revise paragraphs with options for different tones or levels of polish. Ideal for improving prose, pacing, or voice without losing author intent.  
- **“Expand” & “Brainstorm”:** Generate new scenes, plot threads, or character moments from short prompts.  
- **“Describe”:** Adds vivid sensory descriptions (sights, sounds, smells, emotions) to deepen immersion.  
- **“Suggest” Mode:** Offers alternative word choices, dialogue improvements, or rephrasings to strengthen writing flow.  
- **Character & Plot Development:** Built-in idea generators for worldbuilding, character backstories, and story arcs.  
- **Editing Companion:** Analyzes tone, rhythm, and variety—helping writers achieve balance between narrative and dialogue.  
- **Collaboration:** Writers can co-create, review, and edit within the app’s collaborative workspace.  
- **Beta Reader Mode:** Provides feedback on pacing, character believability, and engagement from an AI reader’s perspective.  

## **Use Cases**

- **Novel Writing:** Expand, edit, or rewrite complex scenes while maintaining narrative flow.  
- **Short Story Development:** Quickly generate ideas or variations for storylines and endings.  
- **Script & Dialogue Drafting:** Refine dialogue tone or inject character-specific authenticity.  
- **Worldbuilding:** Generate environments, lore, and character dynamics for fantasy or sci-fi writing.  
- **Creative Editing:** Use for on-demand edits that retain author voice while improving rhythm and clarity.  

## **Pricing Overview**

Sudowrite operates on a **subscription-based model**:

- **Starter Plan:** Around $10/month for smaller project workloads.  
- **Professional Plan:** ~$25/month, providing higher word limits and advanced features like Beta Reader.  
- **Team/Enterprise Plans:** Custom tiers for editors, co-authors, and writers’ rooms.  
- *Pricing subject to change—see [Sudowrite Pricing](https://www.sudowrite.com/) for latest details.*

## **Expert Notes & Tips**

- Sudowrite is ideal for **fiction and long-form storytelling**, rather than technical or factual writing.  
- Use “Describe” to enrich first drafts with sensory or emotional depth—it’s one of the platform’s signature strengths.  
- Avoid relying on it for plot logic or factual continuity; use it for creativity, not fact-checking.  
- If using other AI tools like [[ChatGPT (OpenAI)]] or [[kb/TOOLS/ai-foundation-models/Claude (Anthropic)]] for outlining, draft the core structure there, then refine in Sudowrite for style and tone.  
- Pair with voice dictation or writing apps (Scrivener, Word, etc.) for optimal workflow integration.
