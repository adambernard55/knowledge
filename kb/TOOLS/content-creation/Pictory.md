* Large library of stock video clips, images, and music tracks.  
* AI voiceover options and ability to upload own voiceover.

**Marketing Use Cases:**

* Repurposing blog posts into short videos for social media (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok).  
* Creating video summaries of webinars or long interviews.  
* Quickly producing promotional videos from scripts.

**Expert Notes & Tips:** Pictory excels at quickly turning text-based content into shareable videos, saving significant time. The AI summarization works best with well-structured articles.
