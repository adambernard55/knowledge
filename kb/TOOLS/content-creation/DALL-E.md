**DALL-E 2 / DALL-E 3 (OpenAI)**

DALL-E (currently DALL-E 3, accessed via ChatGPT Plus/Team/Enterprise and API) is an AI system developed by OpenAI that generates novel images and art from natural language descriptions (text prompts). It can create original images in various styles, combining concepts, attributes, and styles specified by the user.

**Key Features:**

* Text-to-image generation with high adherence to prompt details (DALL-E 3).  
* Ability to generate images in different styles (photorealistic, cartoon, oil painting, etc.).  
* Outpainting: Extending existing images beyond their original borders.  
* Inpainting: Editing specific parts of an image based on text prompts.  
* Integration within ChatGPT interface (for subscribers) and via API.

**Marketing Use Cases:**

* Creating unique featured images for blog posts and articles.  
* Generating custom illustrations for social media or website content.  
* Visualizing concepts for presentations or marketing materials.  
* Creating unique ad creatives (requires careful prompting and review).  
* Developing mood board visuals for campaigns.

**Pricing Overview:** DALL-E 3 access is included in ChatGPT Plus/Team/Enterprise subscriptions (typically around $20/month for Plus). API usage is priced per image generated, based on quality/resolution. DALL-E 2 might still be accessible via specific platforms or older API calls with separate credit-based pricing. *Subject to change; check OpenAI website for current pricing and access.*

**Expert Notes & Tips:** DALL-E 3 generally follows prompts more accurately than DALL-E 2 or many competitors, especially regarding text within images and specific details. Prompting requires clarity and iteration. Understand OpenAI's usage policies regarding commercial use and content restrictions. Great for generating specific conceptual images when artistic flair (like Midjourney) is less critical than prompt adherence.
