* **Custom Pricing for Enterprise:** Enterprise plans are typically custom-quoted based on specific organizational needs.  
* **Starting Price:** Team plans might start in the range of **$18 \- $25 per user per month**, but enterprise solutions will be significantly higher.

* The initial setup of comprehensive style guides and terminology is crucial for maximizing the platform's benefits.  
* It's particularly valuable for larger companies with multiple writers, departments, or agencies contributing to content creation.  
* Use the analytics to understand common writing issues within the team and refine training or style guidelines accordingly.  
* The CoWrite features can significantly speed up drafting, but human oversight and editing remain essential for high-quality, strategic content.  
* Encourage team adoption and consistent use of the tool across all writing platforms for best results.
