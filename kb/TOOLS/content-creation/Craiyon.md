# **Craiyon (formerly DALL-E mini)**

Craiyon is a free-to-use AI image generator that creates images from text prompts. It gained popularity as DALL-E mini and is known for its accessibility and often quirky or abstract image results.

**Key Features:**

* Simple web interface for entering text prompts.  
* Generates a grid of 9 images per prompt.  
* Different style options sometimes available (Art, Photo, Drawing, None).  
* Option to specify negative prompts (things to exclude).  
* Free to use (ad-supported).

**Marketing Use Cases:**

* Quickly visualizing rough concepts or ideas.  
* Generating quirky or meme-style images for informal social media posts.  
* Creating placeholder images during the early stages of content development.  
* Experimenting with AI image generation without cost.

**Pricing Overview:** Free to use, supported by ads. May offer premium tiers for faster generation, no ads, no watermarks, and higher priority access, potentially starting around $5-$6/month. *Subject to change; check website for current pricing.*

**Expert Notes & Tips:** Craiyon is incredibly accessible for anyone wanting to try text-to-image AI. Image quality and coherence are generally lower than paid competitors like Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Stable Diffusion implementations. Results can be unpredictable or humorous. Best used for experimentation, fun, or very basic concept visualization rather than high-quality final marketing assets. Check usage rights if considering for commercial purposes (especially on free tier).
