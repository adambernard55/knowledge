# **Google Docs**

Google Docs is a widely used web-based word processor, part of the Google Workspace suite. While primarily a document editor, it integrates AI features (often through Google Workspace AI add-ons like Gemini for Workspace) to assist with writing, summarizing, and brainstorming.

**Key Features (Core \+ AI hints):**

* Real-time collaboration and commenting.  
* Revision history.  
* Templates for various document types.  
* Integration with other Google services (Drive, Sheets, Slides).  
* Add-ons for extended functionality.  
* **Integrated AI (via Gemini for Workspace/Duet AI):** Writing assistance ("Help me write"), text summarization, tone adjustment, brainstorming, grammar/spelling checks (enhanced).

**Marketing Use Cases:**

* Collaboratively drafting marketing plans, content briefs, and blog posts.  
* Using AI features to generate initial drafts or overcome writer's block within the document.  
* Summarizing long research documents or meeting notes directly in Docs.  
* Proofreading and refining copy with enhanced grammar and style suggestions.  
* Creating shared knowledge base documents for marketing teams.

**Pricing Overview:** Google Docs is free for personal use with a Google account. AI features (Gemini for Workspace) typically require a paid Google Workspace subscription plus potentially an additional AI add-on fee per user per month. Workspace plans vary, and the AI add-on might be around $20-$30/user/month. *Subject to change; check Google Workspace website for current pricing.*

**Expert Notes & Tips:** The primary value is leveraging AI directly within the familiar Google Docs environment many teams already use. AI features are assistive; they help speed up drafting and refining but require human oversight. Collaboration features remain a core strength. Evaluate if the cost of the Workspace AI add-on justifies the convenience compared to using standalone AI tools and copy-pasting.
