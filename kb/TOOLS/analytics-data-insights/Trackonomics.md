# Trackonomics

**Trackonomics** (now part of impact.com) is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help content publishers, brands, and agencies create, analyze, and optimize affiliate content at scale. Functioning as a Data Management Platform (DMP) for e-commerce affiliates, it simplifies the content journey by offering robust data aggregation, granular revenue attribution, and link automation capabilities.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Consolidation & Aggregation:** Pulls data from over 100 affiliate networks and ad platforms into a single, customizable BI dashboard for unified reporting.
- **Revenue Attribution (Funnel Relay):** Tracks the entire customer journey from click to purchase, identifying exactly how much revenue each specific link or article generates.
- **Link Automation:** The Publisher Extension (Chrome) allows users to generate affiliate links across multiple networks instantly without logging into separate platforms.
- **Link Scanning & Optimization:** Automatically detects broken or out-of-stock links to prevent lost revenue and ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Content Discovery:** Helps users identify high-potential advertisers and competing products using aggregated performance metrics.
- **Page Categorization:** Uses a proprietary NLP algorithm to automatically assign categories to pages, enabling performance analysis by shopping category.
- **Bot Click Detection:** Partners with DeviceAtlas to filter out non-human traffic, aligning click metrics more closely with network data.
- **Amazon AutoTagger:** Enables page-level analytics for Amazon Associates, compatible with AMP sites via LinkWrapper.

## **Use Cases**

- **Optimize Affiliate Revenue:** Pinpoint best-selling articles, brands, and traffic sources to focus efforts on high-yield content.
- **Streamline Operations:** Automate time-consuming tasks like manual link tagging and data consolidation, freeing up teams to produce more content.
- **Content Strategy:** Analyze performance data to understand which topics and formats drive the most revenue.
- **Link Health Management:** Automatically identify and replace broken links to minimize revenue leakage.
- **Competitive Intelligence:** Use link intelligence tools to research trending products and merchants in the market.
- **Scale Branded Content:** Provide editorial teams with the insights needed to maximize the value of commerce content operations.

## **Pricing Overview**

Trackonomics operates on a **custom enterprise pricing model**:

- **Custom Quotes:** Pricing is tailored based on the number of networks, online properties, and features required.
- **Estimated Cost:** Industry data suggests average costs around **$16,000 annually**, with higher tiers reaching upwards of **$29,000**.
- **No Free Tier:** The platform does not typically offer a free trial or freemium version, reflecting its focus on enterprise-level publishers.
- *Pricing is subject to change; contact Trackonomics for a demo and specific quote.*

## **Expert Notes & Tips**

- Trackonomics is best suited for **large publishers** and agencies serious about scaling their affiliate monetization; it is likely overkill for small bloggers.
- The **Funnel Relay** script is a standout feature for attribution but requires implementation on the publisher's site (often via Tag Manager).
- Its ability to **aggregate data** from disparate networks into one view is considered seamless and a major time-saver.
- Clients receive a **dedicated Partner Success Manager**, ensuring strong support during onboarding and ongoing operations.
- While powerful, adding **net new networks** that are not already supported can sometimes be a friction point.
