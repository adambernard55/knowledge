# WEVO Pulse

## Executive Summary

**WEVO Pulse** is a specialized User Experience (UX) and Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) platform that bridges the gap between quantitative data and qualitative human insight. By combining artificial intelligence with feedback from real human users, WEVO diagnoses *why* visitors are not converting. It is particularly valuable for enterprise marketing and product teams looking to validate designs and optimize user journeys before committing to live code or A/B testing.

## 1. Core Platform Capabilities

WEVO distinguishes itself by offering "pre-live" optimization, allowing teams to test concepts and live pages alike to predict performance outcomes.

### 1.1 AI-Powered UX Diagnostics

-   **Friction Identification:** The platform analyzes digital experiences to pinpoint specific areas of confusion, design clutter, or messaging disconnects that cause users to bounce.
-   **Sentiment Analysis:** AI processes qualitative feedback to categorize user sentiment, highlighting emotional responses to brand messaging and visual design.
-   **Benchmarking:** Compares your website’s user experience against industry standards and competitors, providing a relative score for clarity, appeal, and credibility.

### 1.2 Qualitative Intelligence at Scale

-   **Target Audience Feedback:** Unlike basic heatmaps, WEVO gathers detailed feedback from real people matching the company's specific target demographics.
-   **The "Why" Behind the Data:** While tools like Google Analytics show *what* users did, WEVO uncovers *why* they did it, providing the narrative context needed to fix conversion blockers.
-   **Rapid Synthesis:** AI synthesizes hundreds of user comments into actionable themes, reducing the time required for manual user research analysis.

## 2. Strategic Use Cases for Marketers & Designers

### 2.1 CRO & Landing Page Optimization

For growth marketers and CRO specialists:

-   **Diagnosing Low Conversion:** Use WEVO to analyze underperforming landing pages. The platform identifies if the issue is related to the value proposition, the page layout, or trust factors.
-   **Reducing Bounce Rates:** Understand the immediate first impression users have of a page to implement changes that increase engagement and time-on-site.
-   **Funnel Optimization:** Evaluate specific steps in the checkout or lead generation flow to remove barriers to entry.

### 2.2 Pre-Live Validation & Redesigns

For product managers and UX designers:

-   **Design Validation:** Test wireframes or high-fidelity mockups before development begins. This "pre-live" testing prevents costly engineering cycles on designs that do not resonate with the target audience.
-   **Hypothesis Generation:** Use WEVO insights to generate data-backed hypotheses for live A/B testing tools (like Adobe Target or Optimizely), increasing the "win rate" of experiments.
-   **Competitor Analysis:** Run WEVO tests on competitor websites to understand their strengths and weaknesses, informing your own differentiation strategy.

## 3. Access, Pricing, and Ecosystem

WEVO targets mid-market to enterprise organizations with a focus on high-volume digital channels.

| Tier | Primary Features | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project-Based** | Single-use diagnostics for specific campaigns or launches. | Agencies or specific redesign projects. |
| **Subscription** | Ongoing access to diagnostics, benchmarking, and predictive scoring. | Enterprise teams with continuous optimization programs. |

*Note: Pricing is custom and typically involves a significant investment, positioning it as a strategic tool for companies prioritizing deep UX maturity.*

## 4. Professional Implementation Strategy

### 4.1 Complementing Quantitative Data

WEVO should not replace **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** but rather complement it. Use GA4 to identify *where* the drop-off is happening (e.g., the pricing page), and then use WEVO to diagnose *why* users are leaving that specific page.

### 4.2 The Testing Roadmap

Integrate WEVO into the beginning of the experimentation workflow.
1.  **Ideation:** Use WEVO to test radical redesigns or new concepts.
2.  **Refinement:** Iterate based on WEVO feedback.
3.  **Validation:** Launch the refined version as a live A/B test to confirm statistical significance.

## 5. Critical Considerations

1.  **Audience Definition:** The quality of insights is directly tied to how well you define the target audience panel. Generic audiences may yield irrelevant feedback for niche B2B products.
2.  **Cost vs. Speed:** While faster than traditional moderated user testing, WEVO is an investment. It is best reserved for high-impact pages (homepages, key landing pages, checkout flows) rather than low-traffic blog posts.
3.  **Predictive Limitations:** While WEVO offers predictive scores, live market variables (seasonality, ad traffic quality) will always influence final conversion rates.
