# Google Search Console

Google Search Console (GSC) is a free service offered by Google that helps website owners monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot their site's presence in Google Search results. It is an essential tool for search engine optimization (SEO), providing direct insights into how Google crawls, indexes, and ranks your website.

## Key Features

- **Search Performance Analysis:** Analyze clicks, impressions, click-through rate (CTR), and average position for the queries, pages, countries, and devices that drive traffic to your site.
- **Index Coverage & Management:** View the index status of all pages on your website to identify and resolve errors that prevent them from appearing in search results.
- **URL Inspection Tool:** Get detailed crawl, index, and serving information for a specific URL directly from the Google index, and request re-indexing for updated pages.
- **Sitemap Submission:** Submit your sitemap to help Google more intelligently discover and crawl your website's content.
- **Page Experience & Core Web Vitals:** Monitor your site's performance on key user experience metrics like loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability.
- **Link Analysis:** View which websites link to yours (backlinks) and which pages on your site are most frequently linked to, both internally and externally.
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Receive email alerts for critical issues detected on your site, such as indexing problems, security vulnerabilities, or manual actions.

## Marketing Use Cases

- **Improve Technical SEO:** Diagnose and fix indexing errors, mobile usability issues, and schema markup problems to improve how Google understands your site.
- **Monitor SEO Health:** Track organic search performance over time, identify ranking drops, and respond to critical site errors flagged by Google.

- **Troubleshoot Specific Pages:** Use the URL Inspection tool to debug why a specific page isn't performing as expected in search results.

## Pricing Overview

Google Search Console is a **completely free service** for all website owners. The only requirement is to verify that you own or manage the website you wish to monitor.

## Expert Notes & Tips
