# AI Foundation Models

The **AI Foundation Models** category explores the core technologies that power today’s generative and intelligent systems. These large-scale models—such as [ChatGPT (OpenAI)](obsidian://open?file=kb%2FTOOLS%2Fai-foundation-models%2FChatGPT%20\(OpenAI\).md), [DeepSeek](obsidian://open?file=kb%2FTOOLS%2Fai-foundation-models%2FDeepSeek.md), [LLaMA](obsidian://open?file=kb%2FTOOLS%2Fai-foundation-models%2FLLaMA.md), and [Mistral](obsidian://open?file=kb%2FTOOLS%2Fai-foundation-models%2FMistral.md)—form the backbone of modern artificial intelligence, capable of understanding, generating, and reasoning across text, code, and multimodal data.

Foundation Models represent a pivotal evolution in AI development. Unlike narrow task-specific systems, they are trained on massive datasets and can be adapted to a wide variety of applications through fine-tuning, prompting, or integration with APIs. From conversational assistants and research engines to self-hosted open-source frameworks, these models enable innovators to build powerful tools and workflows without starting from scratch.
