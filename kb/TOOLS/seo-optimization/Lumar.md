## 1. Core Platform Capabilities

Lumar's platform is built to handle the complexity of large, dynamic websites, providing a comprehensive suite of tools for deep technical analysis.

- **Enterprise-Scale Website Crawling:** Capable of crawling millions of pages on complex websites, including those heavily reliant on JavaScript, to provide a complete picture of the site's structure and health.

- **AI-Powered Monitoring & Analytics:**
    - **Anomaly Detection:** Uses machine learning to automatically detect unusual patterns or deviations in website data that could signal critical problems.
    - **Change Tracking:** Continuously monitors the site for any changes—intentional or not—that could impact SEO performance and sends real-time alerts.
