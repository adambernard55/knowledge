# **Google Keyword Planner**

Google Keyword Planner is a free tool provided by Google Ads designed to help advertisers (and content creators) research keywords for their search campaigns. It allows users to discover new keyword ideas, see historical search volume data, and get forecasts for keyword performance.

**Key Features:**

* Discover New Keywords: Get keyword ideas based on seed keywords, phrases, or a website URL.  
* Get Search Volume and Forecasts: See historical search volume trends, competition levels (low, medium, high), and bid estimates for keywords. Forecast potential clicks and impressions for keywords in Google Ads campaigns.  
* Keyword Organization: Group keywords into ad groups for campaign building.  
* Filtering and Refining options.

**Marketing Use Cases:**

* Identifying relevant keywords to target for SEO content (blog posts, landing pages).  
* Finding keywords for Google Ads campaigns.  
* Understanding the relative popularity and competition level of different keywords.  
* Discovering related terms and LSI keywords around a core topic.  
* Gauging search trends and seasonality for specific terms.

**Pricing Overview:** Free to use, but requires a Google account. Full functionality (e.g., exact search volume numbers instead of ranges) is often prioritized or more readily available for accounts actively spending on Google Ads.

**Expert Notes & Tips:** Keyword Planner is a foundational tool for keyword research, directly sourcing data from Google. While search volume data can sometimes be broad ranges for non-advertising accounts, it's invaluable for understanding relative demand and discovering initial keyword ideas. Use it in conjunction with tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, or AnswerThePublic for more detailed analysis, difficulty metrics, and content ideas. Essential starting point for both SEO and PPC keyword research.
