# Typeform

**Typeform** is a platform designed to create visually appealing and conversational online forms, surveys, and quizzes. Its core philosophy is to make data collection feel more like a conversation than an interrogation by presenting one question at a time. This user-centric approach is designed to increase engagement and completion rates. While primarily a form builder, it incorporates subtle AI features to assist with question generation and analysis.

## **Key Features**

- **Conversational Interface:** Presents questions one by one, creating a focused and interactive experience for the user.
- **Logic Jumps:** Dynamically changes the question flow based on a user's previous answers, creating a personalized and relevant path for each respondent.
- **Wide Range of Question Types:** Supports multiple choice, ratings, short/long text, file uploads, payment fields, and more.
- **Design Customization:** Offers extensive templates and design options to ensure forms align with brand identity.
- **Hidden Fields:** Pass data to the form via URL parameters to track campaigns or pre-fill information for known users.
- **Robust Integrations:** Connects seamlessly with hundreds of third-party apps, including CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce), email marketing tools (Mailchimp), and analytics platforms (Google Analytics).
- **Data Collection & Reporting:** Provides a built-in dashboard to view responses, generate simple reports, and export data.

## **Use Cases**

- **Lead Generation & Qualification:** Create engaging contact forms, quote requests, or interactive quizzes that capture and qualify leads more effectively than static forms.
- **Customer & Market Research:** Deploy beautiful surveys for customer feedback (NPS, CSAT), market research, and product validation.
- **Registration & Onboarding:** Simplify event registration, user onboarding, or job application processes with a smooth, step-by-step flow.
- **E-commerce & Payments:** Build simple order forms or collect payments for services directly within the form by integrating with Stripe.

## **Pricing Overview**

Typeform operates on a freemium model with tiered subscriptions:
- **Free Plan:** Offers basic functionality with limits on the number of forms, questions per form, and monthly responses.
- **Paid Plans (Basic, Plus, Business):** Tiers scale based on the number of monthly responses, team members, and access to advanced features like logic jumps, payment collection, file uploads, and premium integrations. Paid plans typically start around $25-$29/month when billed annually.
- *Always check the official website for the most current pricing information.*

## **Expert Notes & Tips**

- **Focus on Experience:** Typeform's primary advantage is its ability to create a superior user experience, which directly translates to higher completion rates and better quality data. It's ideal for customer-facing interactions where brand perception matters.
- **Leverage Logic Jumps:** This is Typeform's superpower. Use it to create tailored experiences that don't waste users' time with irrelevant questions.
- **Keep it Concise:** While the interface is engaging, respect the user's time. Aim for focused forms that are as short as possible to achieve your goal.
- **Integrate into Your Stack:** Connect Typeform to your CRM or email marketing platform to automate follow-ups and ensure data flows seamlessly into your systems.
- **AI is an Enhancement, Not the Core:** The AI features are helpful for suggesting question types or analyzing sentiment but don't expect a full generative AI experience. The core value remains in the conversational design.
