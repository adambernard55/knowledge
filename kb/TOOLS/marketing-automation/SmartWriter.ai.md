* The quality of personalization depends on the publicly available information about the prospect. It works best for prospects with an active online presence (especially LinkedIn).  
* **Always review and approve AI-generated personalized snippets.** While the AI can find impressive angles, ensure the tone is appropriate and the information is accurate before sending.  
* Use it to make your outreach feel genuine and well-researched, not creepy.  
* Combine the AI-generated personalization with a strong value proposition in your outreach message.  
* A/B test different types of personalization angles to see what resonates best with your target audience.  
* Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations when collecting and using prospect information for personalization.  
* It's a powerful tool for breaking through the noise of generic cold outreach.
