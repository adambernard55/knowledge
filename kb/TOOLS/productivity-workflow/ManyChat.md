**Expert Notes & Tips:** ManyChat is very effective for automating rule-based conversations on Meta platforms and SMS. Its visual flow builder is intuitive. Focus on creating value for the user, not just broadcasting messages. Ensure compliance with platform policies (especially regarding promotional broadcasts). Use segmentation and tagging to personalize interactions. While it has some NLP, complex AI conversations are better handled by platforms integrating larger language models. Great for automating common interactions and lead capture on social messaging apps.
