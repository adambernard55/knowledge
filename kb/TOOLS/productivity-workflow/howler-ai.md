**Summary:** Howler AI is a platform designed to help businesses and PR professionals automate and optimize their media outreach efforts. It uses AI to identify relevant journalists, podcasters, and influencers, personalize email pitches, and track outreach performance, aiming to increase the chances of getting media coverage.

**AI Focus:** AI is used for journalist/influencer discovery and relevance matching, email personalization (suggesting tailored pitch angles or subject lines), and potentially for analyzing pitch effectiveness.

**Key Features:**

* **Targeted Media List Building:** AI helps identify journalists, bloggers, podcasters, and influencers who are most relevant to a specific story, industry, or announcement.  
* **Contact Database:** Access to a database of media contacts with information on their coverage areas, publications, and recent work.

* **Pitch Templates & Optimization:** May offer templates for different types of pitches and tools to help optimize pitch content for better open and response rates.  
* **Follow-Up Automation:** Features to schedule and automate follow-up emails.  
* **Performance Tracking & Analytics:** Tracks email open rates, click-through rates, and replies to measure outreach effectiveness.  
* **Media Monitoring (Potentially):** May include features to monitor for mentions or coverage resulting from outreach.  
* **CRM for Media Contacts:** Tools to manage relationships with media contacts.

**Marketing Use Cases (Primarily PR & Communications):**

* **Public Relations Outreach:** Efficiently finding and pitching relevant journalists and media outlets for press releases, news announcements, or story ideas.  
* **Podcast Guest Pitching:** Identifying and contacting relevant podcasters to propose guest appearances.

* **Improving Pitch Personalization & Relevance.**

**Pricing Overview:**

* **Subscription-based SaaS model.**  
* **Tiered Plans:** Likely offers different plans based on factors such as the number of contacts reached per month, number of users, access to database size, AI personalization features, and analytics capabilities.  
* **Starting Price:** For PR outreach tools with AI capabilities, plans might start in the range of **$49 \- $199+ per month**, with higher tiers for more extensive usage or agency needs.  
* **Free Trial/Demo:** Often offers a free trial or a demo to showcase the platform's features.  
* Specific pricing details would need to be obtained from the official Howler AI website.

**Expert Notes & Tips:**

* Howler AI aims to make media outreach more targeted and efficient by leveraging AI for list building and pitch personalization.  
* **While AI can suggest personalization, always review and further customize pitches** to make them genuine, concise, and highly relevant to the specific journalist or influencer. Generic-sounding AI pitches will likely be ignored.  
* Building genuine relationships with media contacts is still crucial. Use the tool to identify and initiate contact, but focus on providing real value.  
* Ensure your story or announcement is truly newsworthy and relevant to the contacts you are pitching.  
* Track your outreach performance closely and refine your pitch angles and target lists based on what works.  
* Be mindful of email sending best practices to avoid being marked as spam.  
* It's a useful tool for streamlining the often time-consuming process of media list building and initial outreach.
