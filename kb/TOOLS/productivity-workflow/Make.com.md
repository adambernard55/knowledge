# Make.com

## What It Is
**Make.com** (formerly known as Integromat) is a powerful no-code platform for automating workflows and building multi-step processes between apps, APIs, and AI models. Its visual builder allows users to design complex data workflows, connect disparate systems, and trigger automated actions with precision.

Unlike basic automation tools, Make.com offers *scenario-based logic*, meaning users can create conditional paths, loops, data transformations, and integrations that operate at a near-developer level — all without writing a single line of code.

## Key Features
- **Visual Builder:** Drag-and-drop interface for designing detailed, modular workflows.
- **Multi-Step Automation:** Enables conditional logic, filtering, and branching between steps.
- **App Integrations:** Connects with 1,500+ apps like Google Workspace, Notion, Slack, HubSpot, Airtable, OpenAI, and more.
- **Webhooks & APIs:** Easily connect custom apps or AI models through REST and GraphQL APIs.
- **AI & Data Integration:** Incorporate OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini into workflows for automated content generation, data extraction, or summarization.
- **Error Handling:** Built-in tools for reruns, data tracking, and scenario debugging.
- **Scheduling & Triggers:** Automate recurring events, new form submissions, or CRM updates in real time.

## Use Cases
- **Marketing Automation:** Sync leads between forms, CRMs, and email tools while generating AI content automatically.
- **Business Operations:** Process internal data flows between HR tools, databases, and messaging systems.
- **AI-Powered Content:** Connect ChatGPT or Claude to automate blog summaries, social updates, or product descriptions.
- **Sales Automation:** Combine Fireflies.ai meeting notes with CRM updates for unified client records.
- **Productivity Workflows:** Automate repetitive admin tasks like data entry or report generation.

## Pricing Overview
Make.com offers a **Freemium** structure with tiered plans:
- **Free Plan:** Limited to ~1,000 operations/month with basic features.
- **Core ($9/month):** More operations, real-time triggers, and simple error handling.
- **Pro ($16/month):** Access to complex scenarios and advanced scheduling.
- **Teams ($29/month per user):** Collaboration workspaces, higher capacity, and priority support.
- **Enterprise:** Scalable solutions with SSO, SLAs, and custom API limits.
