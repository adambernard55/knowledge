# Supabase AI

**Supabase AI** is an integrated assistant within the **Supabase** platform that helps developers write, debug, and optimize SQL queries and backend logic using natural language. It’s designed to streamline database management and improve developer productivity when working with PostgreSQL and Supabase’s backend tools.

## **Key Features**

- **Natural Language to SQL:** Write queries in plain language (“show me all users who signed up last month”) and automatically generate optimized SQL.  
- **Code Debugging:** Analyze errors or broken queries and receive corrected SQL or database recommendations.  
- **Schema-Aware Understanding:** The AI reads your database schema to produce accurate, context-aware queries specific to your tables and relationships.  
- **Function Generation:** Automatically create stored procedures, authentication workflows, or API logic directly in SQL or JavaScript.  
- **Documentation Summaries:** Ask questions about Supabase functions, APIs, and libraries for quick in-IDE reference.  
- **Postgres Optimization:** Suggests best practices for indexing, performance tuning, and query design.  
- **Interactive SQL Editor:** Integrated directly into the Supabase dashboard for real-time suggestion and execution.  
- **AI Code Partner:** Complements your workflow with GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Replit for a seamless backend development experience.  

## **Use Cases**

- **Database Setup & Management:** Create and modify tables, define relationships, and generate SQL migrations from plain commands.  
- **Query Acceleration:** Write complex SQL joins or analytics queries without manually recalling syntax.  
- **Error Debugging:** Get instant fixes for syntax or runtime SQL errors.  
- **Data Insights:** Ask questions about your dataset (e.g., “What’s the most popular product?”) and get executable queries.  
- **Backend Automation:** Build Postgres functions or Supabase Edge Functions powered by AI assistance.  
- **Education:** Ideal for learners who want to understand or practice SQL through conversational examples.  

## **Pricing Overview**

Supabase AI is available as part of the main **Supabase platform**, following its **freemium** model:  

- **Free Tier:** Includes access to Supabase AI for learners and small projects.  
- **Pro & Team Plans:** Offer increased AI query generation limits, advanced collaboration, and enhanced database resources.  
- **Enterprise Plans:** Provide custom AI query capacities, project scaling, and dedicated support.  

*Always check [supabase.com/pricing](https://supabase.com/pricing) for details on usage limits and plan inclusions.*

## **Expert Notes & Tips**

- Supabase AI is optimized for **PostgreSQL**, making it ideal for modern full-stack and serverless development.  
- Use **clear, descriptive prompts** to generate safe and efficient SQL. It’s schema-aware — meaning it understands your database structure for more precise results.  
- Pair it with **Vercel**, **Replit**, or **Windsurf** for end-to-end AI-driven app development.  
- Ideal for developers who want a **Postgres alternative to ChatGPT’s code interpreter** within a real database context.  
- For complex analytics or schema design, validate AI-suggested SQL before deploying in production.
