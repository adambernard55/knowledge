# Cursor

Cursor is an AI-first code editor built as a fork of Visual Studio Code, designed from the ground up to integrate artificial intelligence deeply into the development workflow. It allows developers to chat with, generate, and edit code using AI that is fully aware of the entire project context, making it a powerful tool for accelerating coding tasks.

## **Key Features:**

*   **Codebase-Aware Chat:** The chat feature is indexed on your entire codebase, allowing you to ask complex questions, get explanations, and generate code that is consistent with your existing project structure and conventions.
*   **Inline AI Editing:** Use a simple command (Ctrl+K) to generate or refactor code directly in the editor, eliminating the need to copy and paste from a separate chat window.
*   **AI-Powered Debugging:** Cursor can analyze errors, inspect stack traces, and suggest fixes with a single click, dramatically speeding up the debugging process.
*   **"Fix Linter Errors" Button:** Automatically resolves linter issues across a file, ensuring code quality and consistency without manual effort.
*   **Generate from Scratch:** Scaffold new components, files, or tests from a high-level prompt, creating a robust starting point in seconds.
*   **VS Code Compatibility:** As a fork of VS Code, Cursor supports all existing themes, extensions, and keybindings, allowing for a seamless transition for developers already in that ecosystem.

## **Developer Use Cases:**

*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly build out new features, APIs, or UI components by describing the desired functionality to the AI.
*   **Code Refactoring & Modernization:** Effortlessly refactor legacy code, convert it to a new language or framework, or improve its overall structure with AI guidance.
*   **Onboarding & Code Exploration:** New team members can get up to speed on a complex codebase by asking the AI to explain how different parts of the project work and interact.
*   **Writing Documentation:** Automatically generate docstrings for functions, add comments to complex logic, or create comprehensive README files.
*   **Test Generation:** Create unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests by simply highlighting a block of code and prompting the AI.

## **Pricing Overview:**
Cursor operates on a freemium model. The **Free** tier offers a limited number of AI interactions with standard models. The **Pro** tier (around $20/month) provides unlimited usage of more advanced models (like GPT-4o), faster responses, and access to all features. A **Business** tier is also available for teams, offering additional collaboration and security features. *Always check the official website for the most current pricing.*

## **Expert Notes & Tips:**
Cursor's key advantage is its native, deeply integrated AI experience, which feels more fluid and powerful than using a plugin like GitHub Copilot within a standard editor. The codebase-aware chat is a game-changer for navigating and understanding large, unfamiliar repositories. For any developer looking to maximize their productivity, Cursor is a "must-try" tool and is rapidly becoming a leading choice for AI-assisted development.
