# Bolt.new

Bolt.new is a "code-first" AI development environment that operates entirely within the browser. It is designed to take a single, high-level prompt describing a web application and autonomously generate the frontend, backend, database schema, and deployment configuration, resulting in a live, functional web app in minutes.

## **Key Features:**

*   **Single-Prompt App Generation:** The core functionality allows users to describe an application (e.g., "a blog with user authentication and a comment section") and have the AI agent build it from scratch.
*   **Full-Stack Capability:** Bolt.new handles the entire stack, generating code for popular frontend frameworks (like React or Svelte) and backend services (like Node.js or Python), including database integration.
*   **Automated Deployment:** Beyond just writing code, the tool automatically handles the entire deployment pipeline, providing a live URL for the generated application.
*   **Browser-Based Environment:** There is zero local setup required. All coding, configuration, and deployment happens in the cloud, accessible from any web browser.
*   **Editable & Exportable Code:** Unlike "no-code" platforms, Bolt.new produces clean, human-readable code that developers can inspect, edit directly in the browser, or export to a standard development environment.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Users can issue follow-up commands to modify features, fix bugs, or add new functionality to the live application.

## **Developer Use Cases:**

*   **Rapid Prototyping & MVP Creation:** Go from an idea to a testable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in a single session to validate concepts with real users.
*   **Building Internal Tools:** Quickly spin up custom admin panels, data dashboards, or internal utilities without diverting significant engineering resources.
*   **Hackathons and Competitions:** Gain a massive speed advantage by scaffolding the entire application structure and boilerplate in the opening minutes of a competition.
*   **Learning New Stacks:** A fantastic educational tool for seeing how a full application is built using a specific tech stack.
*   **Generating Microservices:** Instantly create and deploy standalone backend services or APIs for larger, distributed systems.

## **Pricing Overview:**
Bolt.new is expected to follow a **freemium** model. The **Free** tier would likely allow for a limited number of projects and deployments on a shared subdomain. Paid **Subscription** tiers would offer more generous resource limits, the ability to use custom domains, private repositories, and advanced features for teams and professional developers. *Always check the official website for current pricing.*

## **Expert Notes & Tips:**
Bolt.new represents the next evolution of AI coding assistants, moving from simple code completion to full-on application generation. It is the ultimate tool for eliminating "Day 1" boilerplate and setup. The key to success is a well-crafted initial prompt; be as specific as possible about your data models, user flows, and key features. While it's perfect for getting a project 90% of the way there, expect to step in for fine-tuning complex logic or unique UI/UX details. It's best viewed as an incredibly powerful starting point, not a complete replacement for a developer.
