## What It Is

ElevenLabs is a leading AI audio research and deployment company, widely recognized for setting the industry standard in **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** and **Voice Cloning**. While initially focused on speech synthesis, it has evolved into a comprehensive audio AI platform that generates speech, sound effects, and dubbed content. Its models are renowned for their low latency and ability to capture human nuance, emotion, and intonation across 32+ languages.

## Core Features

### 1. Advanced Speech Synthesis

- **Contextual Awareness:** The AI understands the context of text to apply correct intonation (e.g., whispering, shouting, or pausing for dramatic effect).
    
- **Multilingual v2 Model:** Automatically detects languages and produces native-grade speech in nearly 30 languages, including Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, and German.
    
- **Turbo Models:** Optimized low-latency models designed specifically for real-time applications and conversational AI agents.
    

### 2. Voice Cloning & Design

- **Instant Voice Cloning (IVC):** Create a usable clone from a sample as short as 60 seconds.
    
- **Professional Voice Cloning (PVC):** A high-fidelity process that trains a verified digital replica of a voice using 30+ minutes of data, perfect for creating a "digital twin."
    
- **Voice Design:** Generate entirely new, synthetic voices by adjusting parameters like gender, age, accent, and accent strength without needing an audio sample.
    

### 3. Speech-to-Speech

- **Performance Transfer:** Instead of typing text, users can upload an audio file. The AI retains the emotion, timing, and delivery of the original file but swaps the voice to a different target voice (e.g., changing a male voice to a female voice while keeping the laughing tone).
    

### 4. Sound Effects (Text-to-SFX)

- **AI Sound Generation:** Users can generate short instrumental tracks, soundscapes, or specific sound effects (e.g., "footsteps on gravel," "cinematic boom") directly from text prompts to complement their audio.
    

## Tools & Workflow

- **Projects:** A long-form content workstation designed for audiobooks and documents. It allows for chapter management, distinct character assignment for dialogue, and granular control over pacing.
    
- **Dubbing Studio:** An end-to-end video localization tool that transcribes, translates, and re-voices video content while attempting to sync the new audio with the original speaker's lip movements.
    
- **Audio Native:** A specialized embedded player for websites and blogs. It automatically converts written articles into narrated audio, improving accessibility and user engagement.
    

## Developer & API

- **Conversational AI:** A dedicated pipeline for building AI agents that can listen and speak in real-time. It handles the orchestration of Voice Activity Detection (VAD), LLM response, and TTS output for ultra-low latency.
    
- **Python/Node.js SDKs:** Comprehensive libraries for integrating voice generation into apps, games, and automation workflows.
    

## Use Cases

- **Localizing Content:** YouTubers and media companies use AI dubbing to release videos in multiple languages simultaneously.
    
- **Interactive Agents:** Developers use the Turbo model to give voice to customer support bots, NPCs in video games, or desktop assistants.
    
- **Publishing:** Authors and news outlets use the _Projects_ tool or _Audio Native_ to turn written works into audiobooks and listenable articles at scale.
    
- **Post-Production:** Filmmakers use Speech-to-Speech to fix dialogue (ADR) or create scratch tracks without bringing actors back to the studio.
