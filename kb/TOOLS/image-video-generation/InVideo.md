# **InVideo**

InVideo is an online video editor and creation platform that enables users, even those without prior video editing experience, to create professional-looking videos quickly using templates, stock media, and AI-powered features.

**Key Features:**

* Large library of customizable video templates for various use cases (ads, intros, presentations, social media).  
* Extensive stock media library (video clips, images, music).  
* Text-to-Video: AI feature to convert scripts or articles into video drafts.  
* Drag-and-drop editor with transitions, text effects, and stickers.  
* AI script generator and voiceover generation options.  
* Collaboration features for teams.  
* Mobile app available for editing on the go.

**Marketing Use Cases:**

* Creating promotional videos for social media campaigns (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube).  
* Developing video ads quickly from templates.  
* Making intro/outro sequences for YouTube channels.  
* Turning blog posts or text content into simple videos using the Text-to-Video feature.  
* Creating slideshow-style videos or presentations with music and voiceover.

**Pricing Overview:** Offers a Free plan with watermarked videos and limited features. Paid subscription plans (Business, Unlimited) remove watermarks, provide access to premium stock media/templates, increase export limits, and add features. Paid plans typically start around $15-$30/month when billed annually. *Subject to change; check website for current pricing.*

**Expert Notes & Tips:** InVideo is particularly strong for template-based video creation, making it easy for beginners to produce polished videos fast. Its Text-to-Video AI is useful for quickly visualizing scripts but often requires manual refinement of scene choices and timing. The vast template library is a major plus for variety. Good alternative to Lumen5/Pictory, potentially with more focus on template-driven creative editing vs. pure text summarization.
