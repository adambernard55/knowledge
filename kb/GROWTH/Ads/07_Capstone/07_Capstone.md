# Capstone Project

This folder represents the culmination of the AI for E-commerce strategy knowledge base -- the bridge from theoretical frameworks to operational application. The capstone project challenges practitioners to consolidate strategic frameworks, AI evaluation methods, and critical thinking into a single, stakeholder-ready deliverable: the **Strategic AI E-commerce Action Plan**.

The action plan methodology requires defining SMART e-commerce goals, selecting and justifying AI tool categories through rigorous STRIVE analysis, mapping personalization and automation strategies to the buyer journey, projecting ROI with defensible attribution methods, and building comprehensive ethical governance. The result is not an academic exercise but a realistic document capable of driving tangible business outcomes.

Beyond plan development, this folder addresses the equally important discipline of **strategy validation** -- subjecting the plan to structured peer review, stress-testing strategic reasoning through scenario-based assessment, and establishing continuous learning practices to maintain strategic currency as AI capabilities and market conditions evolve.
