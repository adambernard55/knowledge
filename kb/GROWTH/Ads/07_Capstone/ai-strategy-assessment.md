# AI Strategy Assessment and Validation

Developing an AI strategy is only half the work. The other half is validating that strategy -- subjecting it to structured scrutiny, testing it against realistic constraints, and establishing mechanisms to keep it current. This reference defines three pillars of strategy validation: peer feedback methodology, scenario-based strategic assessment, and continuous learning practices.

## Pillar 1: Structured Peer Feedback

### Why Peer Review Matters

An AI strategy developed in isolation carries blind-spot risk. Axiomatically, the strategist who designed the plan is the least equipped to identify its weaknesses. Structured peer feedback provides external perspective on assumptions, logic gaps, and overlooked risks.

### The Five-Dimension Feedback Framework

Effective peer review of an AI e-commerce strategy should evaluate five dimensions systematically:

| Dimension | Evaluation Focus | Key Questions |
|---|---|---|
| **Clarity and Specificity** | Are strategic objectives clear, concrete, and measurable? | Can a reader unfamiliar with the business understand the goals? Are SMART criteria genuinely met? |
| **Strategic Justification and Alignment** | Are AI tool category selections well-reasoned and connected to goals? | Does the STRIVE analysis demonstrate critical thinking? Is the logical chain from goal to AI category to expected outcome defensible? |
| **Potential Impact and Feasibility** | Are projected outcomes realistic given the business context? | Are implementation plans achievable with stated resources? Are timelines credible? |
| **Ethical Rigor and Foresight** | Are ethical considerations specific and comprehensive? | Does the ethics section address plausible risks for this business rather than generic statements? Are mitigation strategies practical? |
| **Actionable Improvement** | What single change would most strengthen the strategy? | Is the suggestion specific, constructive, and implementable? |

### Feedback Delivery Standards

Heuristically, the most useful peer feedback follows three rules:

1. **Specificity over generality** -- "The ROI projection for the chatbot initiative lacks a cost baseline" is useful. "The ROI section needs work" is not.
2. **Evidence-based critique** -- Reference specific sections, data points, or framework criteria when identifying weaknesses.
3. **Constructive framing** -- Every identified weakness should be paired with a directional suggestion for improvement.

### Common Blind Spots in AI Strategy Review

Peer reviewers should be particularly alert to these recurring strategic weaknesses:

- **Optimism bias in ROI projections** -- projections that assume best-case adoption rates without sensitivity analysis
- **Integration complexity underestimation** -- plans that treat system integration as a checkbox rather than a risk vector
- **Ethical governance as afterthought** -- ethics sections that read as compliance boilerplate rather than genuine risk analysis
- **KPI selection without attribution clarity** -- metrics that sound impressive but lack clear measurement methodology
- **Missing resource constraints** -- strategies that do not account for team capacity, technical debt, or change management requirements

## Pillar 2: Scenario-Based Strategic Assessment

### Assessment Philosophy

Scenario-based assessment tests the strategist's ability to apply frameworks under pressure -- with constraints, trade-offs, and ambiguity. The goal is not rote recall of SMART or STRIVE definitions but rather the capacity to deploy these frameworks analytically in realistic situations.

### Five Core Scenario Types

Strategic AI competence can be assessed across five scenario categories. Each category tests a distinct dimension of strategic reasoning.

#### 1. AI Investment Prioritization Under Constraints

**The challenge:** Given a limited budget, legacy technology stack, or constrained team capacity, determine which AI initiatives to pursue, defer, or eliminate.

**What strong responses demonstrate:**
- Explicit trade-off analysis between competing initiatives
- Use of STRIVE criteria (particularly ROI, Integration, and Technical Efficacy) to rank options
- Recognition that sequencing matters -- some initiatives create enabling conditions for others
- Acknowledgment of opportunity cost when deprioritizing initiatives

**Example framing:** An e-commerce retailer has budget for only one AI initiative in Q3. Option A is a personalization engine projected to increase AOV by 12%. Option B is a predictive analytics platform projected to reduce churn by 18%. Both score well on STRIVE. The strategic question is which initiative creates more compounding value over a two-year horizon given the business's current growth-versus-retention balance.

#### 2. Ethical Evaluation and Bias Mitigation

**The challenge:** Identify ethical risks in a proposed AI deployment and design mitigation strategies that balance business objectives with customer protection.

**What strong responses demonstrate:**
- Identification of specific bias vectors (not generic "bias is bad" statements)
- Proportional mitigation strategies that are operationally feasible
- Recognition of tension between personalization effectiveness and privacy
- Consideration of differential impact across customer segments

#### 3. Scaling AI Pilot Projects

**The challenge:** A successful AI pilot needs to transition to full-scale deployment. Determine what changes in infrastructure, governance, measurement, and team structure are required.

**What strong responses demonstrate:**
- Understanding that pilot success does not guarantee scaled success -- conditions change
- Identification of scaling-specific risks (data volume, latency requirements, edge cases)
- Recognition that governance requirements increase with deployment scope
- Planning for organizational change management alongside technical scaling

#### 4. KPI Selection and Attribution Design

**The challenge:** For a given AI initiative, identify the most meaningful KPIs and design an attribution methodology that can isolate AI's contribution to business outcomes.

**What strong responses demonstrate:**
- Distinction between vanity metrics and decision-driving metrics
- Understanding of attribution challenges in multi-channel e-commerce
- Practical attribution approaches (A/B testing, holdout groups, pre-post analysis)
- Honest acknowledgment of attribution limitations and proposed approximation strategies

#### 5. Strategic AI Tool Category Selection

**The challenge:** Given a specific business context and set of SMART goals, evaluate and recommend the optimal AI tool category using STRIVE analysis.

**What strong responses demonstrate:**
- Systematic STRIVE evaluation rather than intuition-based selection
- Consideration of how the selected category interacts with existing technology and processes
- Assessment of the category's fit for the business's current maturity level
- Forward-looking evaluation of how needs may evolve and whether the category accommodates growth

## Pillar 3: Continuous Strategic Learning

### The Currency Problem

AI strategy is conditionally valid -- valid under the conditions that existed when the strategy was developed. Those conditions change rapidly. New AI capabilities emerge, competitive landscapes shift, regulatory frameworks evolve, and customer expectations advance. A strategy that was defensible six months ago may be outdated today.

### Four Practices for Maintaining Strategic Currency

**1. Structured Environmental Scanning**

Establish a regular cadence for monitoring developments across four domains:

| Domain | What to Monitor | Sources |
|---|---|---|
| **Technology** | New AI capabilities, platform updates, emerging tool categories | Analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester), vendor announcements, technical publications |
| **Competitive** | Competitor AI deployments, industry benchmarks, market positioning shifts | Industry conferences, competitor analysis tools, trade publications |
| **Regulatory** | Privacy law updates, AI governance frameworks, compliance requirements | Legal advisories, regulatory body publications, professional associations |
| **Customer** | Changing expectations, adoption patterns, trust dynamics | Customer surveys, social listening, behavioral analytics, support ticket analysis |

**2. Periodic Strategy Reassessment**

Heuristically, a full AI strategy review should occur at minimum every six months, with lighter quarterly check-ins against KPIs. The reassessment should re-run STRIVE analysis for existing tool categories to confirm continued fit and evaluate whether new categories warrant consideration.

**3. Community and Knowledge Network Participation**

No organization can maintain strategic currency in isolation. Active participation in professional communities, attendance at industry events, and engagement with thought leaders in AI ethics, e-commerce innovation, and marketing technology provide essential external perspective. These interactions often surface emerging patterns before they appear in formal publications.

**4. Experimentation Discipline**

Continuous learning requires a structured experimentation practice. Dedicate a defined portion of AI resources to testing emerging capabilities on low-risk, bounded initiatives. Each experiment should have clear hypotheses, success criteria, and a predetermined evaluation timeline. Speculative investments in emerging AI capabilities -- when bounded and measured -- often yield the insights that inform the next strategic cycle.

## Integrating Assessment into Strategic Practice

Assessment and validation are not one-time events. They form a cycle:

1. **Develop** the strategy using the action plan framework (SMART goals, STRIVE analysis, journey mapping, measurement planning, ethical governance).
2. **Validate** through peer feedback using the five-dimension framework.
3. **Stress-test** through scenario-based assessment across the five core scenario types.
4. **Deploy** the validated strategy with established KPIs and attribution methods.
5. **Monitor** through continuous improvement cycles and environmental scanning.
6. **Reassess** at defined intervals, updating STRIVE evaluations and SMART goals as conditions evolve.

This cycle ensures that AI strategy remains a living practice rather than a static document -- adaptable, defensible, and aligned with both business objectives and ethical obligations.
