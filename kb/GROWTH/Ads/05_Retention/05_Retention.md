# Retention — AI for Post-Purchase, Loyalty & Advocacy

The e-commerce journey does not conclude at checkout. The post-purchase phase represents the highest-leverage opportunity to cultivate enduring customer relationships, boost Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and transform satisfied buyers into brand advocates. This folder contains reference documents covering the strategic deployment of AI across the full post-purchase lifecycle.

## Scope

The Retention domain addresses five interconnected areas:

1. **Personalized post-purchase communication** — AI-tailored follow-ups, shipping intelligence, onboarding sequences, and strategically timed review and UGC solicitation.
2. **Churn prediction and re-engagement** — AI models that detect at-risk customers through behavioral and transactional signals, triggering personalized retention interventions before disengagement becomes irreversible.
3. **Dynamic loyalty programs** — AI-powered personalization of rewards, tiering, gamification, and redemption experiences that move beyond generic points systems.
4. **CLV optimization** — Accurate lifetime value prediction that informs acquisition spending, retention investment, product development, and resource allocation across the customer lifecycle.
5. **Brand advocacy and community** — AI identification of potential advocates, empowerment strategies for authentic word-of-mouth, and management of online communities as loyalty and feedback hubs.
