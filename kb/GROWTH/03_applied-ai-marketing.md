# Applied AI Marketing: Frameworks and Implementation

## 1. From Theory to Practice

**Applied AI Marketing** translates artificial intelligence concepts into daily marketing execution. Where [[kb/AI/4_applications/marketing/00_foundations-of-ai-powered-marketing|Foundations of AI-Powered Marketing]] explains *why* AI matters, this reference focuses on *how* to implement it effectively across workflows and channels to achieve measurable business outcomes.

It introduces structured frameworks, tool-evaluation criteria, and key implementation templates to ensure marketers can integrate AI responsibly, repeatedly, and at scale.

---

## 2. The Applied AI Framework

Applied AI implementation follows a five-phase loop common in modern marketing operations:

1.  **Identify Opportunity:** Select repetitive, data-heavy, or underperforming marketing activities.
2.  **Choose AI Tools:** Evaluate platforms based on function, integration, and data privacy.
3.  **Customize Prompts & Templates:** Adapt frameworks to fit specific campaign objectives and brand voice.
4.  **Deploy and Measure:** Integrate AI outputs into workflows and define clear KPIs.
5.  **Refine and Scale:** Audit performance, document learnings, and expand successful use cases.

This cyclical approach transforms ad-hoc experimentation into a sustainable system for operational improvement.

## 3. Core Frameworks and Templates

### 3.1 Prompt Engineering with PTCF

The **Persona – Task – Context – Format (PTCF)** model is the foundation for controlled and repeatable AI communication.

**Example Prompt Framework:**
`Act as an expert copywriter for a B2B SaaS brand (Persona). Write three headlines for a new blog post (Task). The post is about using AI to improve customer retention and targets marketing managers at mid-sized companies (Context). Provide the output as a numbered list (Format).`

Using a consistent structure like PTCF ensures on-brand outputs across different tools and team members.

### 3.2 ROI Tracking Template

This framework helps evaluate the direct and indirect benefits of AI adoption.

| Metric | Formula / Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Productivity Gain** | (Hours saved per task) x (Hourly cost of employee) |
| **Performance Lift** | (% change in CTR or Conversion Rate) vs. non-AI baseline |
| **Cost Savings** | (Cost of outsourced work) - (Cost of AI tool subscription) |
| **ROI** | (Total Gains - Total Investment) / Total Investment |

Regularly tracking these metrics creates a clear business case for continued AI investment.

## 4. Selecting and Evaluating AI Tools

Use a standardized scorecard to make objective decisions when choosing new tools.

| Evaluation Area | Key Question |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Functionality** | Does it solve a specific, high-value problem for our team? |
| **Integration** | Can it connect with our existing CRM, CMS, or data pipelines? |
| **Ease of Use** | Is the learning curve manageable for the intended users? |
| **Data Privacy** | How is our data used, stored, and protected? Is it compliant? |
| **Scalability** | Can it support more users or higher volumes as we grow? |
| **Support & Docs** | Is the vendor's support responsive and documentation clear? |

Maintaining these scorecards in a shared directory documents procurement decisions and supports governance reviews.

## 5. Applying AI Across Marketing Channels

### 5.1 Content & SEO
- **Ideation:** Use AI to analyze SERPs and identify topic gaps and user questions.
- **Drafting:** Generate outlines and first drafts of articles, which are then refined by human experts.
- **Optimization:** Employ tools like Surfer SEO to score content against top competitors and generate optimization suggestions.

### 5.2 Email Marketing
- **Segmentation:** Use predictive models in platforms like HubSpot or Klaviyo to identify user segments (e.g., "likely to churn").
- **Copywriting:** A/B test AI-generated subject lines and body copy to improve open and click-through rates.
- **Send-Time Optimization:** Leverage machine learning to personalize send times for each contact based on their past engagement.

### 5.3 Social Media Management
- **Content Creation:** Generate platform-specific captions, image ideas, and video scripts.
- **Scheduling:** Use AI to forecast the optimal posting times for maximum engagement.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Monitor brand mentions and campaign feedback to gauge public sentiment in real-time.

## 6. Governance and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement for human judgment. Every AI-powered workflow must include a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** checkpoint.

| Concern | Risk Scenario | Governance Practice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | A model "hallucinates" incorrect facts or statistics. | **Mandatory Fact-Checking:** All data points must be verified by a human editor before publication. |
| **Brand Voice** | AI output is generic and lacks brand personality. | **Editorial Review:** Content must pass through an editor to ensure it aligns with brand tone and style guides. |
| **Bias** | An algorithm for ad targeting inadvertently excludes certain demographics. | **Auditing & Monitoring:** Regularly review campaign performance data for fairness and inclusivity. |
| **Transparency** | Users are misled by AI-generated content (e.g., deepfakes). | **Clear Disclosure:** Label AI-generated materials, especially realistic images or videos, where appropriate. |

The HITL principle ensures that AI enhances marketing effectiveness without compromising on quality, ethics, or brand integrity.
