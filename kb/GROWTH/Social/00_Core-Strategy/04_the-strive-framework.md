## Overview
The **STRIVE Framework** is designed to move evaluation beyond feature lists to assess strategic value and operational fit.

## S - Strategic Fit & Alignment
*Does the tool align with core objectives?*
*   Does it solve a significant problem or offer a marginal gain?
*   Does it offer a competitive advantage not easily replicated?
*   **Key Check:** Ensure the tool serves the strategy, not the other way around.

## T - Technical Efficacy & Performance
*Is the underlying technology sound?*
*   How accurate/reliable are the outputs?
*   What are the data requirements (quality/quantity)?
*   Is the model state-of-the-art or legacy?

## R - ROI & Scalability
*What is the financial impact?*
*   **TCO:** Total Cost of Ownership (subscription + implementation + training).
*   **Return:** Time saved, conversion lift, or CPA reduction.
*   **Scalability:** Can it handle increased data volume as the business grows?

## I - Integration & Usability
*Does it fit the stack?*
*   API capabilities and native connectors (CRM, Analytics).
*   User interface intuition and learning curve.
*   Data portability (input/output ease).

## V - Vendor Viability & Support
*Is the partner reliable?*
*   Vendor reputation and financial stability.
*   Product roadmap and update frequency.
*   Quality of documentation and support.

## E - Ethical & Compliance Alignment
*Is it safe and responsible?*
*   Data privacy (GDPR/CCPA) and storage location.
*   Algorithmic bias mitigation.
*   Transparency/Explainability of decisions.
