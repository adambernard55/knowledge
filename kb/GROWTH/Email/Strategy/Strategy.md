## Strategic Foundations of AI in Email Marketing

This module establishes the strategic groundwork for integrating artificial intelligence into email marketing operations. The five reference documents in this folder progress from foundational strategy through technology concepts, customer-centricity principles, tool evaluation, and goal-setting methodology.

The module addresses five questions that every organization must answer before deploying AI in email marketing: **Why is AI a strategic imperative rather than a tactical convenience?** What core technologies power AI email capabilities? How does customer-centricity govern AI deployment decisions? Which tools exist and how are they evaluated? And how are AI initiatives measured against defined objectives?

Collectively, these references provide the conceptual and operational foundation required before moving into applied AI techniques such as advanced personalization, dynamic content, segmentation, and workflow automation.

## Reading Order

The references are designed for sequential reading but function independently. Readers new to AI email strategy should follow the STR-01 through STR-05 sequence. Readers with existing AI knowledge may enter at any reference point — each document is self-contained and does not depend on prior references for comprehension.
